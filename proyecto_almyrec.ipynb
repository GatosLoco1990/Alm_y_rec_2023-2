As an alternative, in this paper, we present a \\nsimulation modeling approach to represent computer net-\\nworks and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to efficiently \\nsimulate cyber attack scenario s. The outcome of the simu-\\nlation model is a set of IDS alerts that can be used to test \\nand evaluate cyber security systems. In particular, the \\nsimulation methodology is designed to test information fu-\\nsion systems for cyber security that are under development.   \\n1 INTRODUCTION \\nAs the use of computer networks grows, cyber security is \\nbecoming increasingly important. To enable systems ad-\\nministrators to better protect their networks, cyber security \\ntools are employed to warn of suspicious network activity. \\nIn some situations, systems administrators have to deal \\nwith millions of such warn ings each day. Consequently, \\nsituational awareness and threat assessment tools that em-\\nploy information fusion techniques are being developed to \\naid in fighting cyber attacks. As these systems are being \\ndeveloped, data is needed to test and evaluate their per-\\nformance. As an alternative to a physical computer net-\\nwork, a simulation modeling methodology is presented. \\nThe simulation method allows the user to construct a vir-\\ntual computer network that produces cyber attack warnings \\nrepresentative of those produced by intrusion detection \\nsystems. Consequently, this flexible simulation modeling \\nframework will enable the efficient generation of data to \\ntest and evaluate situational awareness and treat assess-\\nment tools for cyber security.  \\nThere is some research in modeling of computer net-\\nworks and cyber attacks. For example, Lee et al. (2004) \\nand Nicol et al. (2003) present simulation modeling meth-\\nods for simulating computer network traffic at the packet level. Although simulating the flow and processing of \\npackets in the computer network is possible (potentially \\nbillions of packets per day), only a small fraction of the \\npackets cause alerts to be produced by the intrusion detec-\\ntion system which in turn would be used by the informa-\\ntion fusion tools. Furthermore, modeling a system at this \\nlevel of detail requires great amounts of time and effort for \\nmodeling as well as requiring large amounts of computer \\nprocessing time for simulating “good” packets. As an al-\\nternative to modeling the details of packet flow in a net-\\nwork, this work presents a simulation model for simulating \\nthe behavior of the intrusion detection system by producing \\nsimulated alerts representative of malicious cyber attacks \\nand non-malicious network activity based on the user’s \\nspecification. Consequently, th e user can efficiently con-\\nstruct scenarios of various computer networks and cyber \\nattacks and generate the corresponding alerts. \\n2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK \\nThis work is based in the need for testing situational \\nawareness tools that are being developed to detect and ana-\\nlyze attacks on computer networks. Since conducting cyber \\nattack experiments on computer systems that contain criti-\\ncal data is very undesirable, several alternatives have been \\nused. One alternative consists of setting up a physical \\ncomputer network absent of any critical data, performing \\ncyber attacks on the network, and collecting data from in-\\ntrusion detection systems. A second alternative consists of \\ngenerating synthetic data through the use of simulation.  \\nThese two approaches have varying degrees of re-\\nquirements, capabilities, and limitations. The physical \\ncomputer network requires the physical machines, net-\\nworking, and IDS components. Consequently, conducting \\nexperiments on various network configurations involving different machines, servers, routing systems, IDS sensors, \\netc. requires reconfiguration of the network and setting up \\nthe network to produce the desired network activity and \\ncyber attacks. The advantage of  using the physical network \\n1180\\n1-4244-1306-0/07/$25.00 ©2007 IEEE\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universidad EAFIT.

This also has some disadvan-\\ntages in that it is impossible to replicate the experiment ex-\\nactly (if so desired) and the data produced is difficult to \\nvalidate to ensure all desired information is accounted for \\nin the ground truth. Since physical networks are not per-\\nfectly reliable, data can be missed, processed incorrectly, \\netc.  \\nThe simulation approach requires knowledge of the \\noperation of the desired network and its operation. This in-\\nformation must be captured by the simulation model to \\nrepresent the behavior of the network. However, as dis-\\ncussed briefly in the introduction, the level of detail in-\\ncluded in the model will depend on the goal of the simula-\\ntion. In this case, the packet level information and \\ncomputer network traffic details are not needed, so the \\nsimulation can be constructed at a higher level to produce \\nalerts caused by cyber attacks and harmless network traffic. \\nOnce the framework of the model has been established, \\nvarious network configurations can be efficiently created \\nand experiments can be conduct ed with various attack sce-\\nnarios. Since the simulation experiments are controlled, \\nthey can be repeated exactly and all ground truth informa-\\ntion is known.  \\n3 OVERVIEW OF THE SIMULATION MODEL \\nA discrete-event simulation model has been developed for \\ngenerating representative cyber attack and intrusion detec-\\ntion sensor alert data. Although  the model is primarily de-\\nsigned to be used in testing cyber situational awareness and \\nanalysis tools, other applications such as training of sys-\\ntems analysts may also make effective use of the model.   \\nThe simulation model is initially implemented in the \\nARENA simulation software. An object-oriented model \\nwritten in Java is currently under development. Although \\nthis paper utilizes the ARENA model to illustrate the mod-\\neling concepts, the focus is on the concepts themselves. \\nThe simulation model provides a user with the ability \\nto construct a representative computer network and setup \\nand execute a series of cyber attacks on certain target ma-\\nchines within that network. IDS sensors that are setup \\nwithin this network produce appropriate alerts based on the \\ntraffic they observe within the network. The alerts pro-\\nduced consist of a combination of the alerts produced as a \\nresult of attack actions and as a result of typical “noise” \\n(non-malicious network traffic that triggers an alert.)   \\nFigure 1 displays an example network interface setup \\nusing the ARENA model. To effectively model a network \\nsetup in ARENA and to provide users that may not have \\nextensive simulation training with a friendly interface, cus-\\ntom modules were created for the network devices. The simulated computer networks consist of three primary \\ntypes of devices: machines, connectors, and subnets.  \\nA machine can represent an individual computer or \\nserver. Machine characteristics can be specified including \\nthe IP address, the operating system, and the type of IDS \\nsensor on the machine (if a ny). For each IDS sensor speci-\\nfied, an associated output file will be generated containing \\nthe sequence of alerts produced when the simulation is run.  \\nA connector represents the means by which computers \\nare connected, such as throu gh a switch or a router. The \\nnetwork connectivity plays in important role in establish-\\ning the path that an attacker can take through the network. \\nThe connector also has network IDS sensors that can be \\nrepresented which are used to monitor any network traffic \\nthat travels through the connector and produce alerts corre-\\nsponding to known potentially harmful actions.  \\nA subnet represents a group of several machines with \\nconnectivity to the network that all share a common set of \\nproperties (such as the operating system). Machines within \\na subnet contain the same set of properties that could be \\nspecified if the machines were  placed into the network in-\\ndividually. The subnet just prov ides an efficient method of \\nspecifying groups of computer s (particularly useful when \\nspecifying large networks.)  \\nConnector lines are used in the model to connect the \\nmodules and represent the connection of machines/subnets \\nto a connector, as well as th e connections between connec-\\ntors themselves.   \\nWhen a computer network has been created, an attack \\nscenario can be setup and run on the network. An attack \\nscenario consists of a series of specified cyber attacks oc-\\ncurring over a period of time along with a specified quan-\\ntity of network noise. A user-i nterface with a series of \\nforms is used to specify the desired scenario. The model \\nstructure enables manual or automatic attack generation. In \\nthe manual mode, the user can specify all of the details of \\nthe attack scenario includin g the sequence and timing of \\nattack actions as well as the path the attack will take \\nthrough the computer network. In the automatic mode, the \\nuser can specify the goal (ultimate attack action and target \\ncomputer) of the attack, and the simulation model will \\ngenerate a random, feasible sequence of attack actions \\nalong a path that leads to the goal. Additional parameters \\nthat represent the behavior of the attacker can also be \\nspecified. These parameters include the efficiency, stealth, \\nand skill of the attack being modeled. The efficiency refers \\nto how direct the attack is, and this utilizes a range between \\n0 and 1, with 1 representing th e most efficient attack path. \\nThe stealth parameter refers to how well the attack avoids \\ndetection, primarily by avoiding intermediate “goal” steps, \\nand this also utilizes a range between 0 and 1. The skill re-\\nfers to the probability of success for each step. \\n1181\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universidad EAFIT. Downloaded on August 04,2023 at 18:48:33 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Also, \\nfor each type of attack, the us er can specify the time be-\\ntween attack steps based on a fixed number or on a random \\nnumber sampled from an exponential distribution (with a \\nspecified mean).  The steps/actions available for use in an \\nattack are chosen from a cat egorized list of 2,237 known \\nexploits in 5 major groups and 23 subgroups.  If no specific \\nexploit is selected, one will be chosen at random based on \\nthe subgroup.  In addition to attacks, the user can specify, \\nthe rate at which non-malicious traffic alerts (noise) is gen-\\nerated, as well as the probability of noise alerts correspond-\\ning to each of the action categories.   \\n Once the scenario has been created, the information is \\nsaved in a file for future use. The simulation is then run, \\nand the attack scenario is exec uted. The output of the simu-\\nlation includes a file listing the actions generated for each \\nattack (known as the “ground truth”) and the time the ac-\\ntion occurred. In addition, an output file containing IDS \\nalerts is produced for each ID S sensor specified in the \\nmodeled network. These files containing IDS alerts are in-\\ntended to be used to test the situational awareness and \\nanalysis tools.   4 SIMULATION METHODOLOGY \\nThis section discusses in detail the general approaches \\ntaken in modeling computer networks, modeling cyber at-\\ntacks, and simulating cyber attacks and generating corre-\\nsponding IDS data. \\n4.1 Modeling Computer Networks \\nAs described in the previous section, the computer network \\nis modeled using two basic constructs: machines and con-\\nnectors. The third construct, subnets, represents a group of \\nmachines. The modules representing the machines, connec-\\ntors, and subnets provide a visual representation of the \\ncomputer network. However, functionally, these modules \\nprovide a logical method for the user to enter the data \\nabout the computer network including whether the ma-\\nchine can be accessed externally from the Internet. The \\nconnecting lines showing the connectivity of the network \\nare used to construct a from-to type of matrix representing \\nthe network topology that will be used in the attack genera-\\ntion. The details of the devices (such as the type of IDS) \\nare stored as variables that can be accessed based on the \\ndevice ID. The devices used can be easily modified by \\n1182\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universidad EAFIT. Downloaded on August 04,2023 at 18:48:33 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.

Although insider attacks \\ncould also be modeled, this is not the primary purpose of \\nthe model. The progress that a hacker can make in an at-\\ntack is dependant upon the hacker’s capabilities and the \\nvulnerabilities of the network. The methods for modeling \\nand simulating the initiation and progression of cyber at-\\ntacks through a computer network included in this model \\nare based on Sudit et al. (2005).  \\nSudit et al. (2005) place the sequence of attack actions \\nthat a hacker may use into st ages that correspond to the \\nhacker’s capabilities given the current state of the network. \\nThese stages are referred to as Stage 0 through Stage 9 \\nwhere Stage 0 represents generally reconnaissance activi-\\nties on the external part of the computer network where the \\nattacker is using exploits to simply gain more information \\nabout the network. (In this discussion an external machine \\nis one that can be accessed from the Internet, and an inter-\\nnal machine is a machine that can only be accessed from \\nan external machine through a firewall or from another in-\\nternal machine.) Stage 0 – Stag e 4 represent hacker actions \\non external machines, and Stag e 5-Stage 9 represent hacker \\nactions on internal machines. Table 1 list some typical \\nhacker actions that corresp ond to an attack stage. \\nThe hacker can attack an organization’s machine that \\nis on the external side of the computer network. Once the \\nexternal machine has been su ccessfully compromised, the \\nhacker can use the compromise d external machine to work their way through the external network until the capability \\nto access internal machines is reached. Once the hacker has \\ninfiltrated the internal network, the internal machines can \\nbe compromised until the hacker reaches their goal. Figure \\n2 illustrates the cyber attack process from the internet to a \\ngoal on an internal machine. \\n \\nTable 1. Typical hacker actions in a cyber attack \\nStage Typical Action \\n0 Recon.

The automated \\nmethod utilizes the network specifications and connectivity \\nin combination with a guidan ce template of the available \\nstages to determine the capabilities of the attacker and vul-\\nnerabilities of the network and generate a feasible sequence \\nof attack steps for the cybe r attacks.  The graph-based \\nguidance template is used to determine which groups of \\nactions are feasible at differen t points of the attack. A dia-\\ngram of the graph-based template that the simulation \\nmodel currently operates under is shown in Figure 3 (S0, \\nS1, …, S9 represent Stage 0, Stage 1, … , Stage 9.)\\n \\n \\nFigure 2.

Nodes within the same \\ngroup form a complete graph in which each node is con-\\nnected to the every other node. This graph-based template \\nis represented as an adjacency  matrix of 1’s and 0’s repre-\\nsenting which stages are accessible after which other \\nstages have been performed.   \\n \\nS0S1\\nS2\\nS3\\nS4S5S6\\nS7S8\\nS9 \\nFigure 3. Directed graph re presenting attack structure \\n \\nGiven the attack structure (in the form of the guid-\\nance template) and the networ k configuration specified, \\nthe user also specifies a target machine, a goal, and sev-\\neral other attack related para meters (discussed previously) \\nthrough a series of forms. Figure 4 illustrates the auto-\\nmated method that is used to generate the specific multi-\\nstage attack. \\nIn generating the steps (prior to simulating them over \\na time period), the methodology works backwards \\nthrough the network by first defining the attack’s target \\nand finding a path up out of the network that the hacker \\ncould attack through.  The logic first chooses an attacker \\n(machine from which the hacker  could execute the attack \\nstep) which is able to communicate with the chosen target \\nbased on the topology of the network.  After the attack \\nprogression for the current target is determined, a new \\ntarget can be chosen.  The options for the new target are a \\nmachine with which the curr ent attacker can communicate \\nor the current attacker itself. Choosing the cu rrent attacker \\nas the new target will move the attack to a higher level of \\nthe network topology (toward the external machines) to \\nmodel the way in which hackers penetrate a network. If \\nthe chosen target is not the current attacker, the logic will \\nrepeat the steps for determining guidance template pro-\\ngression and determine another target, using Stage 5 \\nthrough Stage 9.  However, if  the current attacker is cho-\\nsen for the new target, the attack generation moves up a \\nlevel in the network topology. Thus, the logic evaluates \\nwhether the chosen target has become an external ma-\\nchine. If the chosen target is  not an external machine, the \\nlogic will choose a new attacker who can reach the new target and repeat the attack generation process. However, \\nif the target is external, th e attacker must be attacking \\nfrom the Internet. Thus, the a ttacker IP address for attacks \\non external machines is cr eated randomly since hackers \\nwill generally “spoof,” or dis guise, their IP address when \\nattacking from the Internet. The logic will then determine \\nthe guidance template progression for the external target, \\nnow using Stage 0 through Stage 4.   \\n \\n \\nFigure 4. Automate attack generation method \\n \\nWhen the guidance template progression is deter-\\nmined, the logic will sample a random value between zero \\nand one and evaluate this valu e against the efficiency fac-\\ntor specified by the user at th e beginning of the simulation \\nrun. If the sampled value is greater than the efficiency \\nfactor, a new target will be chosen and the attack genera-\\ntion steps repeated. If the sampled value is less than the \\nefficiency factor, the attack generation is complete. \\nIf the user prefers to specify  the specific steps of the \\nattack, various levels of automation are provided down to \\nattacks that can be fully specified by the user. \\n1184\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universidad EAFIT.

One entity is created at \\nthe beginning of the simulation to represent each attack. \\nEach entity is assigned a unique attack identification \\nnumber. Then the entity executes the appropriate code \\nthat samples the necessary attack information. Each entity \\nrepresenting an attack stores  information about the first \\nstep of the attack in its defined list of attributes. The at-\\ntack information about the firs t attack step. Then the en-\\ntity is delayed until the first step in the attack is specified \\nto start. This delay can be constant or can be sampled ran-\\ndomly from an exponential distribution depending on the \\nuser’s specification. Finally, the entity is routed to the sta-\\ntion corresponding to the target IP address for the first at-\\ntack step. \\nA generic station sub-model represents each of the \\nmachine locations in the computer network. When entities \\n(attacks) are routed to the sta tion, the attack step is exe-\\ncuted. The success of the atta ck step is evaluated by sam-\\npling from a uniform distribution on (0,1) and comparing \\nthis number with the skill parameter (or probability of \\nsuccess) defined for the attack. If the step fails, the neces-\\nsary attack step information is sampled, the attack infor-\\nmation is assigned to attributes, the target IP station is de-\\ntermined, the entity is delayed, and the entity is then \\nrouted to the appropriate sta tion similar to the sequence of \\nactions executed above. If the attack step succeeds, the \\nattack step number is incremented by one, and the next \\nstep in the attack is executed. Depending on the result, the \\nappropriate  alert information is written to output files. \\nThis process is repeated until the last step in the attack is \\nexecuted successfully. At this point, the number of com-\\npleted attacks is tallied, and the entity is disposed.  \\nThe simulation model generates both attacks and \\nnoise. The noise represents ID S alerts produced by ordi-\\nnary network activity. The occu rrence rate of noise alerts \\nare specified by the user, and generated via a Poisson ar-\\nrival process.  \\nThe simulation dynamically produces several output \\nfiles. These files include grou nd truth files for the attack \\naction and IDS alerts, and ID S alert files. The Ground \\nTruth Actions file contains a listing of the hacker attack \\nactions that were executed during each attack as well as \\nan indication of whether each ac tion was successful or not. \\nThe ground truth files for ID S alerts are produced for each \\ntype of IDS that is used in the system and contains all of \\nthe alert information corresp onding to the actual attack \\nactions and excludes any no ise alerts. Finally, the IDS \\nalert files that are produced include form atted alerts which \\nare dependent on the location of the IDS in the network. \\nThe IDS alert files include al erts produced from both at-tack actions and noise and are representative of the infor-\\nmation that a system administrator may receive when us-\\ning IDSs to monitor network activity.  \\n5 CYBER ATTACK EXAMPLE \\nIn this section, an example attack scenario on a computer \\nnetwork is presented. The scenario makes use of the \\nautomatic attack generator to create two separate attacks \\n5.1 Attack Descriptions \\nThe network diagram is shown in Figure 8. The goal of \\nthe first attack is to create a backdoor on a machine in the \\nBPN Group subnet, while the goal of the second attack is \\nto perform pilfering on an ma chine in the Research Group \\n1 subnet. For both attacks, information is gathered about \\nthe external network, and th en the VPN server is pene-\\ntrated. The server is then used  as a stepping stone to reach \\nthe target machine. Since the automatic attack generator is \\nused, the attack steps are not entered by the user, but in-\\nstead are generated during the simulation. \\nThe computer network created using the Cyber At-\\ntack Simulator is shown in Figure 6. A summary of the \\nnetwork is as follows: \\n\\u3000 1 main web-server; \\n\\u3000 3 main subnet domains; \\n\\u3000 2 subnet domains have further subnets attached; \\n\\u3000 Only one external machine; and  \\n\\u3000 Red dots indicate IDS sensor presence. \\n \\n \\nFigure 6.

The scenario has 150 noise \\nalerts per hour on average where 85% of the noise is re-\\nconnaissance, 10% is escalation, and 5% is classified as \\nmiscellaneous. Also, the simulation will run for five addi-\\ntional minutes after the last attack is complete. This simu-\\nlation run results in the generation of the steps shown in Table 3, considered the ground truth. The steps are sorted \\nby the time at which they occur. \\n The combination of these attack steps and the noise \\nwithin the network create a la rge number of IDS sensor \\nalerts during the simulation ru n.

Figure 8 illustrates the \\napplication of information fusion to a system. The ground \\ntruth is the actual status of the system. From the ground \\ntruth, a set of data or information can be sensed and \\npassed to an information fusion process. The fused infor-\\nmation is passed to a decision maker that may take some \\naction on the system in attempt to change the system \\nstatus.  \\n \\nFigure 8. Information fusion applied to a system \\n \\nSome of the most difficult aspects of developing in-\\nformation fusion methods are validation and evaluation. \\nThe validation and evaluation processes both require data \\nfor testing and experimentatio n. In some cases, the sys-\\ntems to which the information fusion process is to be used \\nare readily available so dire ct experimentation can take \\nplace. However, in many applications the systems for \\nwhich the information fusion processes are being de-\\nsigned do not exist, may be destructive, or may be cost \\nprohibitive to set up. In these cases, simulation provides a \\ngood alternative. \\nFor example, in the context of cyber security, situ-\\national awareness and threat assessment tools including \\ninformation fusion techniques are being developed to aid \\nsystems administrators in identifying and analyzing cyber \\nattacks on computer networks  (Sudit et al. 2005). These \\ntools work by primarily processing alerts produced by in-\\ntrusion detection systems (sensors) on the computer net-\\nwork. To test and evaluate th ese tools, physical computer \\nnetworks have been set up to perform experiments from \\nwhich data is collected. As an alternative, a simulation modeling method and software is developed to generate \\nsynthetic data. \\nThe simulation modeling methodology is a first step \\nat presenting a flexible modeling framework that will eas-\\nily allow a user to specify the configuration of the com-\\nputer network under study and efficiently generate cyber \\nattacks. The output that the simulation model gives, repre-\\nsents the actual alerts that a system administrator would \\nsee in their daily duties. Consequently, there is great po-\\ntential for continued development of this model to cyber \\napplications ranging from network evaluation to training.  \\n7 CURRENT DEVELOPMENT \\nCurrent work entails the development of an object-\\noriented Java simulation model. The primary motivation \\nbehind this development is to create a simulator that is \\nplatform independent and easier to use for individuals \\nwith expertise in computer networks and cyber security \\nrather than simulation. This new model improves upon \\nthe ARENA model by providing several features allowing \\nfor networks and attacks to be defined in more detail and \\nallowing for a wider range of inputs to and outputs from \\nthe model. These features include: \\n• Allowing multiple attack scenarios to be created \\nand saved with a network; \\n• Separating the auto-attack generation and event \\nsimulation, and providing a display for each; \\n• Defining a list of services running on a machine; \\n• Defining a list of ports/protocols that are allowed \\nor banned through a specific connector path; \\n• Utilizing the machine vulnerabilities and connec-\\ntor attributes to determine the selection and the \\nsuccess of an action/exploit (as opposed to strict \\nprobability); \\n• Allowing network traffic to be routed through \\nmore than two connectors (based on connector \\nlink attributes); and \\n• Exporting a modeled network to a “Virtual Ter-\\nrain” XML file or importing a network into the \\nmodel from a “Virtual Terrain” XML file (The \\nconcept of a “Virtual Terrain” is used to repre-\\nsent networks in the Information Fusion realm). \\nOngoing work entails the continued validation and \\nthe addition of features to enhance the model to represent \\ncyber attacks on computer networks as accurately as pos-\\nsible. \\n8 CONCLUSIONS \\nThe Cyber Attack Simulator presented in this paper is ca-\\npable of generating IDS alert and ground truth files based \\non the specification of a com puter network and attacks. \\nThe simulator is built with a user interface to allow the \\ncreation of various computer network configurations and Ground Truth  \\nInformation \\nFusion \\n \\nDecisions \\n Sensed Data \\n1187\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universidad EAFIT.

INTRODUCTION  \\nComputer virus is an executable code able to reproduce itself which can destroy the operating system and files of a co mputer [1].  It \\naffects efficient performance and production of the busines s firms and other economic entities. Not only these e ntities are affected \\nby computer virus but also those individuals having important f iles kept in the computer. In this study, the spread of comput er virus \\nis modelled on the basis of the users’ computer security b ehaviour.  \\nEmployees in a certain organization play an essential role  in keeping their computer free from virus infection in order  to maintain \\nthe integrity and safety of the information. It is somew hat significant to consider what influences a user to obs erve computer \\nsecurity procedures.  \\nTo further improve the security level, users have to make responsive choices to act in accordance with the manageme nt’s security \\npolicies and implement computer security behavior. Thus, o rganizations have been employing security trainings and aw areness \\nprograms to educate users [2]. \\nII. PROBLEM  STATEMENT \\nThis study determines the effect of Users’ computer security behaviour towards the spread of computer virus. It is so ught to answer \\nthe following questions: \\nA. What is the rate of infection of a computer owned by a us er who rarely transfers files from outside source and does  not update \\nhis antivirus software regularly? \\nB. What is the rate of infection of a computer owned by a user who sometimes transfers or copies files from outside  source and \\nupdate his antivirus software regularly? \\nC. What is the rate of infection of a computer owned by a us er who frequently transfers or copies files from outside source and \\nupdate the antivirus software regularly? \\nD. How long will it make 80% rate of infection for a user wh o frequently transfers or copies files from outside source  and is not \\nupdating his antivirus software regularly?  \\nE. What is the effect of transferring of files to a non updat ed antivirus software installed in a computer? \\nIII. OBJECTIVES \\nA. The Objectives of the Study are as Follows \\n1) To determine the rate of infection of a computer owned by a user who rarely transfers files from outside source and does \\nnot update his antivirus software regularly; \\n2) To determine the rate of infection of a computer owned by  a user who sometimes transfers or copies files from outside \\nsource and update his antivirus software regularly; \\n3) To determine the rate of infection of a computer owned by  a user who frequently transfers or copies files from outs ide \\nsource and update his antivirus software regularly; International Journal for Research in Applied Science &  Engineering Technology (IJRASET ) \\n                                                                                           ISSN: 2321-9653; IC V alue: 45.98; SJ Impact Factor: 6.887 \\n                                                                                                                Volume 6 Issue VII, July 2018- Available at www.ijrase t.com \\n     \\n 713 © IJRASET: All Rights are Reserved  \\n \\n4) To determine how long will it make 80% rate of infection  for a user who frequently transfers or copies files from  outside \\nsource and is not updating his antivirus software regularly; an d \\n5) To determine the effect of file transfer to a non updated an tivirus software installed in a computer. \\n \\nIV. RELATED  LITERATURE \\nThe framework used for this study is the AIDS model found in the  NetLogo. NetLogo is a multi-agent programmable modellin g \\nenvironment. It is used by tens of thousands of students, teachers and researchers worldwide [3]. It also powers HubN et \\nparticipatory simulations. Indeed, it is authored by Uri Wil ensky and developed at the Center of Connected Learning and Co mputer-\\nBased Modelling [4].  \\nFurthermore, there are research studies that model the spr ead of computer virus in order to predict future threats and the rate of \\ninfection in a machine over a period of time. An example  of this study is the proliferation of computer virus in human intervention: \\nA dynamical model by [5]. The study scrutinized the proliferati on behaviour of computer virus in human intervention. A dyna mical \\nmodel recounting the spread of computer virus, in which a v ulnerable computer can be recovered directly and an infected computer \\ncan be vulnerable directly. During a qualitative analysis  of this model, findings revealed that the virus-free stabili ty is globally \\nasymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number R0 ≤1, whereas the viral equilibrium is globally asymptoti cally stable if \\nR0 >1. Based on the findings and a parameter analysis, sev eral suitable methods for eliminating the propagation of c omputer virus \\nacross the internet are suggested. \\n In an organizational context, a study by [2] regarding users’ comput er security behaviour in a Health Belief perspective. It explor ed \\nwhat impact a user to exercise computer security. The study ut ilized the Health Belief Model, adapted from the healt hcare literature \\nto study the computer behaviour of the users. The model was validated through the use of survey data from 134 respondents.  \\nFindings revealed that perceived benefits, perceived susceptib ility, and self efficacy are determinants of email rel ated security \\nbehaviour. Perceived asperity moderates the effects of g eneral security orientation, perceived benefits, cues to a ction, and self-\\nefficacy on security behaviour.  \\nReference [6] explained the factors affecting the propagatio n of computer viruses in removable storage devices. It offe red a way \\nother than the internet for the proliferation of computer vi rus. Nevertheless, almost all earlier models of viruses  deemed that internet \\nwas the source of the virus spread, ignoring the remov able device route at all. In this study, a novel propagation model of computer \\nviruses, which integrate the effect of removable device, wa s recommended. Moreover, the model divulges a distinctive  virus \\nstability, which is shown to be globally asymptoticall y stable. The result means that any attempt to elimi nate viruses failed to \\nsucceed. By scrutinizing the relevant influences of system factors, a lot of guidelines are suggested so as to limit  the quantity of the \\ninfected computers to an acceptable threshold.  \\nOutbreak dynamics of computer viruses is a promising disci pline aiming to recognize the way that computer viruses p ropagate on \\ncomputer networks. Meanwhile, [7] intended to create a serie s of realistic endemic models of computer viruses. Initia lly, a close \\nexamination of some frequent types shared by all usual com puter viruses clearly tells the defects of prior models. Af terwards, a \\ngeneric epidemic model of viruses named as the SLBS model, wa s recommended. Certainly, various generalizations of the SLBS \\nmodel are recommended.   \\nReference [8] examined the results of infected removable st orage devices and external computers on the spread of computer v iruses. \\nBecause of this, a new compelling model of four sections was proposed. The investigation of the model revealed that  the distinctive \\nequilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. This result  is well fitting for numerical operation. An interpretati on  of the influences \\nof infected removable storage devices and computers was al so contained. Besides, it was found out that (1) removable  storage media \\nand external computers that were infected by the virus can bo th accelerate it spread; (2) infected removable storage devices can \\ncause a greater risk than infected computers.   \\nIn order to curb the spread of computer virus on the Intern et, a new Susceptible-Infected-External (SIE) model, a study of [9], which \\nconsidered the impact of external computers on virus propa gation behaviour, was put forward. This model puts external an d internal \\ncomputers as a whole to study. By applying dynamical stabil ity theory, the existence and global stabilities of virus-free and viral \\nequilibrium were fully studied. Based on the further analysis of numerical simulation results and system parameters, some  eﬀective \\nmeasures controlling the prevalence of virus were suggest ed. \\nV.

The model relies on the Following Basic Assumptions \\n1) External source of files (internet, removable storage de vice) can be the source of computer virus.    \\n2) The more transfer of files from external source the more  chances the computer will be infected by computer virus.  \\n3) Once the computer virus begins to infect the file, it wil l infect other files in the system. \\n4) Computer is vulnerable to virus infection once antivirus in stalled is not updated.The model then simulates the scenari o on how \\nthe computer virus enters the computer based on the users’ com puter security behaviour.

RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSIONS \\n Based from the result of trials from Table II through Ta ble IV, it is found out that the spread of computer virus  is slower if the user \\nwill always update the antivirus software installed in his  computer. However, the rate of infection becomes faster  once the user will \\nnot update his antivirus software. In other words, the spr ead of computer virus is directly proportional to the ave rage frequency of \\nfile transfer from outside source and none updating of antivirus in a computer. Additionally, even if there is a frequent transfer or \\nmoving of files from outside source (e.g. removable disk, i nternet) as long as the user will update the antivirus sof tware installed in \\nhis/her computer, there is a lesser probability of virus  attack. \\nTable II.

CONCLUSION \\nThe spread of computer virus was due to user’s failure to update antivirus software installed in a computer. Therefor e, computer \\nvirus infection is largely dictated by the behaviour charact eristics of the computer users. Such behaviour characteristi cs may deter to \\nfacilitate the spread of the virus. In turn, informed us ers are more likely to exercise caution and observe prac tices that stop the \\nspread of the virus. \\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATIONS  AND  FUTURE  WORKS \\nA user must always update the antivirus installed in his/her computer at all times. Effective antivirus software that  has auto update \\nand auto block feature must be considered in choosing antivirus  software. The author recommends for the next work to m odel and \\nsimulate the spread of computer virus on complex network.  \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] Computer Viruses\", 123helpme.com, 2016. [Online].

This study aims to develop a simulation-optimization model to integrate the \\nfinancial and physical flows in a supply chain planning problem under economic uncertainty. The simulation- \\noptimization model includes a mixed-integer linear programming model and a simulation-based optimization \\nmodel that are connected through an iterative process. The economic value added (EVA) index is used to measure \\nthe financial performance of the supply chain. This study extends the literature on two research domains namely \\nsupply chain planning and finance and simulation-optimization modelling for supply chain management. The \\nproposed model applies a scenario approach to cope with economic uncertainty in the supply chain. To \\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model, the performance of the proposed model in solving a test \\nproblem from the recent literature is compared with the performance of a conventional simulation-based opti-\\nmization and mixed-integer linear programming approaches. The results of the study show a minimum of 6% \\nimprovement in the EVA obtained from the proposed simulation-optimization model compared to the EVA \\nobtained from the simulation-based optimization model in all the studied scenarios. Moreover, the standard \\ndeviation of the EVA obtained from the proposed simulation-optimization model is at least 69% lower than the \\nEVA obtained from the mixed integer programming model in all the studied scenarios. This shows that the \\nproposed simulation-optimisation approach is more robust to economic uncertainty than the mixed-integer linear \\nprogramming approach.   \\n1.Introduction \\nThe efficient management of the supply chain (SC) is not a tool which \\nonly helps organizations to gain a competitive edge but is a requirement \\nthat allows them to survive in a highly competitive business environ -\\nment. SC management (SCM) connects the participants involved in a \\nvalue chain of a product or service through modelling the physical, \\nfinancial, and information flows across the chain. An SC system can be a \\ncomplex system as it encompasses autonomous entities (i.e. suppliers, \\nmanufacturers, retailers), the processes in a value chain of a product or \\nservice such as procurement, production, distribution, and the un-\\ncertainties which might be internal such as uncertainty in the distribu -\\ntion lead time or external such as uncertainty in the end customers ’ \\ndemands [1]. Various planning decisions need to be made to manage \\nthis complex system [2]. All these planning decisions are impacted by financial resource \\nallocation. That is to say, implementing planning decisions relies on the \\navailability of financial resources [3]. For instance, a new facility in a SC \\ncannot be opened unless the funding mechanism is explicit. Moreover, \\noptimising planning decisions may save financial resources. For \\nexample, optimizing inventory decisions leads to savings in financial \\nresources which in turn can provide the required resources for imple -\\nmenting other planning decisions such as production capacity expan -\\nsion. Therefore, Incorporating the financial aspect of SCM in SC \\nplanning models ensures the availability of financial resources for \\nimplementing planning decisions and also provides opportunities on \\nsaving financial resources [4,5]. \\nThe financial aspect of SCM is incorporated in SC planning models in \\ntwo ways: (1) considering costs associated with SC activities such as \\nproduction and inventory holding and deducting these costs from SC \\n*Corresponding author. \\nE-mail addresses: e.badakhshan@shu.ac.uk (E.

The \\nsmooth flow of cash within an SC enables SC members to meet their \\noperations expenses and also invest the excess cash, inflow minus the \\nrequired, for a return. The challenge faced by the SC members is to \\ndecide on the level of cash to be held for operations expenses as they \\nstrive to make a trade-off between adequacy of cash for meeting oper-\\nations expenses and minimizing the opportunity cost which is incurred \\nas a result of holding cash. \\nLiterature on SCM merely considers the costs associated with SC \\nactivities and ignores the flow of cash within SCs [6,7]. Recently more \\nattention has been given to the study of the cash flow through SCs in \\naddition to the cost of activities (e.g., [5,8–10]). These studies consider \\nvarious sources of uncertainty. The most frequently considered source of \\nuncertainty is demand uncertainty (e.g., [10–12]). However, there are \\nlimited studies that consider economic uncertainty which refers to un-\\ncertainties in microeconomic, macroeconomic, financial and market \\nconditions. Economic uncertainty has a significant impact on both the \\nprofitability of SCs and the flow of cash within SCs. For instance, \\nincreasing short-term and long-term interest rates leads to the increased \\ncost of debt for SC members and consequently reduced profitability of \\nthe SC. From a cash flow perspective, this increases the opportunity cost \\nof holding cash by SC members and also reduces the availability of cash \\nfor SC members as the investors’ willingness to invest in the stock \\nmarket decreases. Therefore, considering the economic uncertainty in \\nSC planning and finance models results in obtaining a more accurate \\nindication of profit and cash flow dynamics within an SC. To measure \\nthe impact of economic uncertainty on SC profitability, we need to \\nemploy indicators which consider the cost of capital employed by a SC \\nwhen calculating SC profitability. Economic value added (EVA) is a \\nmetric that deducts the cost of capital employed by a SC from its income \\nto provide a more realistic representation of SC profitability. Moreover, \\nstudies in the literature have not considered cash holding cost as an \\nelement in SC total cost. Incorporating cash holding cost into the SC total \\ncost enables us to minimise the opportunity cost of holding cash by \\nminimizing the level of cash held by SC members. \\nTo address the gaps in the literature, we develop a simulation- \\noptimization framework that incorporates cash flow modelling and \\nuncertainties in macroeconomic and microeconomic parameters in an \\nSC planning problem. The developed model adds the cash holding cost \\nto SC’s total cost. The reason for choosing the simulation-optimization \\nmethodology is its ability to integrate the benefits of both simulation \\nand optimization. Optimization models are capable of identifying the \\noptimal SC decisions but incorporating complexities including nonlinear \\nrelationships, delays, and feedback loops that exist in cash and physical \\nflows of the SCs significantly increases their computational cost. On the \\nother hand, simulation models are powerful tools for modelling the SC \\ncomplexities, however, they are not able to determine the optimal SC \\ndecisions. This makes simulation-optimization an effective tool for \\naddressing complex SC problems [13,14]. \\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows: the literature review is \\npresented in Section 2. The problem description and the proposed \\nsimulation-optimization approach are described in Section 3. Section 4 \\nelaborates the model formulation. Section 5 illustrates the applicability \\nof the proposed model through a case study. Finally, conclusions and \\ndirections for future research are given in Section 6. \\n2.Literature review \\nTwo major research domains that are relevant to this study are: SC \\nplanning and finance and simulation-optimization modelling for SC \\nmanagement. Therefore, the literature review is organized in line with \\nthese two major research domains. This study integrates these research \\nstrands to address an integrated SC physical and financial flows planning \\nproblem under microeconomic and macroeconomic uncertainties. 2.1. SC planning and finance \\nSeveral works incorporated financial flow modelling into the SC \\nplanning problem. Table 1 provides a summary of the SC planning and \\nfinance literature. There are two main gaps in the literature. Firstly, \\nmuch of the literature has developed mixed integer linear programming \\n(MILP) models that ignore nonlinearities, delays, and feedback loops \\nthat exist in the physical and financial flows of the SCs (e.g., [[15–19]]). \\nNaraharisetti et al. [16] developed a MILP model that considered budget \\nconstraints. Zhang et al. [19] presented a MILP model that aimed to \\nminimize the cash conversion cycle in an SC. Ramezani et al. [17] \\ndeveloped a MILP model that aimed to identify the optimal financial \\ndecisions such as the optimal level of current and fixed assets in an SC. \\nSimulation-optimization modelling which is an efficient tool for \\ncapturing the nonlinearities, delays, and feedback loops that exist in the \\nphysical and financial flows of the SCs, remains underrepresented in the \\nliterature [20–22]. Although Utama et al. [23] highlighted the efficiency \\nof simulation-optimisation for addressing the integrated SC planning \\nTable 1 \\nSC planning and finance literature.  \\nAuthor(s) Modelling Approach Model Objectives Uncertain \\nParameters \\nMelo et al.

To fill this gap, we present a simulation-optimization model \\nwhich incorporates SC dynamics including nonlinearities, delays, and \\nfeedback loops that exist in the physical and financial flows of the SCs. \\nApplying simulation-optimization modelling results in identifying the \\noptimal SC decisions in a more realistic environment as the \\nsimulation-optimization is an efficient approach for capturing SC \\ndynamics. \\nSecondly, there is limited research that considers uncertainties in \\nboth microeconomic and macroeconomic parameters (e.g., [24–26]). \\nPuigjaner and Laínez, [24] considered demand, price, and interest rate \\nuncertainties. Nickel et al. [25] considered demand and interest rates \\nuncertainties. Longinidis and Georgiadis [26] considered uncertainties \\nin demand, interest rates, expected return of the market, and the \\nrisk-free rate of interest. de Matta [28] considered uncertainties in the \\nproduct price and transfer price. To fill this gap, we consider the un-\\ncertainties in both microeconomic and macroeconomic parameters \\nincluding demand, interest rates, expected return of the market, and the \\nrisk-free rate of interest. \\nThirdly, to the best of our knowledge no study incorporates cash \\nholding cost into SC total cost. This enables us to minimise the oppor -\\ntunity cost which is incurred as a result of holding cash by SC members. \\nTo fill this gap, we consider cash holding cost in SC total cost. \\nFourthly, the previous studies consider price as an uncontrollable \\nparameter. They are the either consider price as a given parameter (e.g., \\n[5,26,31 ]) or consider price as an uncertain parameter (e.g., [24,28 ]). In \\nthis study, we formulate price as a controllable parameter and identify \\nits optimal value. \\nAs it is shown in Table 1, this study makes four contributions to the \\nliterature on SC planning and finance: (1) It uses simulation- \\noptimisation which is an under-represented modelling approach in the \\nliterature. Although its efficiency has been highlighted [23], (2) It \\nconsiders the uncertainties in both microeconomic and macroeconomic \\nparameters as opposed to much of the literature which consider either \\nmacroeconomic or microeconomic parameters, (3) It incorporates cash \\nholding cost into SC total cost as opposed to previous studies which \\nignore this, and (4) formulate price as a controllable parameter and \\nidentifies its optimal value as opposed to literature which consider price \\nas a given parameter or an uncertain parameter. \\n2.2. Simulation-optimization modelling for SC management \\nSimulation-optimization modelling refers to any combination of \\nsimulation and optimization approaches [32]. Shanthikumar and Sar-\\ngent [33] classified simulation-optimization models into two main cat-\\negories: (1) hybrid models in which simulation and optimization \\napproaches are combined into one single model, and (2) hybrid \\nmodelling that includes constructing independent simulation and opti-\\nmization models and then integrating the solution strategy through \\nestablishing a feedback structure. The hybrid models are further divided \\ninto simulation-based optimization and optimization-based simulation \\nmodels. Simulation-based optimization (SBO) relates to incorporating \\noptimization algorithms into simulation models to identify the optimal \\nvalues for the decision parameters of the simulation model. The \\noptimization-based simulation is concerned with the computation of the \\noptimization model parameters using simulation or sampling of the \\noptimization model scenarios using simulation [32,34 ]. \\nA review of studies in simulation-optimization modelling for SC \\nmanagement has revealed two main gaps in the literature. Firstly, much \\nof the literature applied discrete-event simulation (DES) as the simula -\\ntion approach in simulation-optimization models (e.g., [35–42]). Ding \\net al. [38] incorporated a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm \\n(NSGA-II) into a DES model to address an integrated network design, \\ndistribution and inventory planning problem. Otamendi and Doncel \\n[41] consolidated GA and DES to manage the trade-offs between total \\ncost and service reliability in a gas transmission SC. Altazin et al. [43] \\nintegrated a MILP and a DES model to address a train rescheduling problem in railway systems. Wery et al. [42] integrated a MILP model \\nand a DES model to address a sales and operations planning problem in \\nthe softwood lumber industry. Chiadamrong and Piyathanavong [37] \\nproposed a hybrid modelling framework in which a MILP model, a DES \\nmodel and the OptQuest optimization toolbox were integrated to \\naddress an SC network design problem. Liu et al. [40] presented a hybrid \\nmodelling framework in which a multi-objective optimization model \\nand a DES model were integrated to address a product design and service \\nplanning problem. System dynamics (SD) simulation that is more effi-\\ncient than the DES in tactical and strategic decision making in SCs is \\nunderrepresented. To fill this gap, we use SD as the simulation technique \\nin a simulation-optimisation model. \\nSecondly, SBO models solely optimize the performance of the \\nsimulation systems by identifying the optimal values for the decision \\nparameters of the simulation models (e.g., [8,44 –48]). Chu et al. [45] \\nand Peirleitner et al. [48] developed SBO models to minimize the total \\ncost of inventory systems by identifying the optimal values for the in-\\nventory decision parameters. Duggan [46] and Aslam and Ng [44] \\ndeveloped SBO models to minimize the bullwhip effect by identifying \\nthe optimal values for the inventory decision parameters. Linn˘eusson \\net al. [47] presented a hybrid model that integrated SD and DES simu-\\nlation and an NSGA-II algorithm to determine the optimal maintenance \\ndecisions. Badakhshan et al. [8] minimized the cash flow bullwhip by \\nidentifying the optimal inventory and financial decision parameters. The \\nperformance of the simulation systems could be enhanced by identifying \\nthe optimal values for the decision variables of the simulation models \\nsuch as the flow of products in the SC networks in addition to the de-\\ncision parameters of the simulation models. Gillis et al. [49] presented a \\nhybrid model which integrated SD and GA to optimise response strate -\\ngies to epidemics. To this end, this paper presents a \\nsimulation-optimization framework which integrates an SBO model, \\nincluding system dynamics and genetic algorithm, and an optimization \\nmodel, MILP. The developed model framework optimizes production \\nand distribution decision variables and inventory and financial decision \\nparameters within the SD simulation model. \\nThis study makes two main contributions to the literature on \\nsimulation-optimisation modelling for SC management: (1) It employs \\nSD which is an under-represented simulation technique as opposed to \\nmuch of the literature which used DES as the simulation technique. SD is \\nmore efficient than the DES in tactical and strategic decision making \\n[50], (2) It determines the optimal values for both decision variables and \\ndecision parameters of a simulation model as opposed to the previous \\nstudies which only identify the optimal values for the decision param -\\neters of a simulation model. \\n3.Problem description and modelling approach \\nThe general structure of the studied SC is depicted in Fig. 1. The SC \\nincludes four stages: (1) suppliers, (2) production centre, (3) distribution \\ncentres, and (4) retailers. In the downstream direction, suppliers provide \\nraw material to the production centre. The products are then manu -\\nfactured in the production centre and shipped to the retailers via dis-\\ntribution centres. The retailers are responsible for meeting customers ’ \\ndemands, which are uncertain and fluctuate in line with the economic \\nenvironment. In the upstream direction, customers pay for products \\npurchased from the retailers. It is assumed that the distribution centres \\nand retailers are owned by the production centre and consequently share \\na common profit. \\nIn the studied SC system, one product and multiple periods are \\nconsidered. The suppliers can fulfil the entire order of the production \\ncentre, while the capacities of other SC members are restricted. The \\nproduction centre can secure long-term and short-term loans. In this \\nstudy, a MILP-SBO model is developed to maximize the economic \\nprofitability of the studied SC by identifying the optimal values for the \\nfollowing decisions: (1) The amount of raw material to be purchased \\nfrom suppliers, (2) The production rate at production centre, (3) The E. Badakhshan and P. Ball                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Operations Research Perspectives 10 (2023) 100270\\n4number of required suppliers and distribution centres, (4) The inventory \\nlevels at SC facilities, (5) The flow of products in the network, (6) The \\nlevel of short-term and long-term liabilities, (7) The level of equity, (8) \\nThe level of fixed and current assets, (9) The level of cash, (10) Price of \\nthe product, (11) Profit distribution policy which denotes the dividends \\nthat is required to be paid to the shareholders. \\nThe modelling approach consists of building independent MILP and \\nSBO models and thereafter integrating these two models to identify the \\noptimal decisions. The connection between the two models is illustrated \\nin Fig. 2. \\nFirstly, by setting the initial price, desired cash, profit distribution \\npolicy, and desired inventories at the production centre, distribution \\ncentres, and retailers, the MILP model that aims to maximise the EVA is \\nrun to determine the structure of the SC including the open or close \\ndecision on distribution centres, select suppliers and the amount of raw \\nmaterial that should be purchased from each supplier. Moreover, the \\nMILP model identifies the optimal values for the production rate at the \\nproduction centre, inventory levels at SC members, the flow of products \\nin the network, short-term and long-term liabilities, equity, fixed and \\ncurrent assets, and cash levels within the SC. \\nIn step 2, the solution suggested by the MILP model determines the \\nstructure of the SC in the system dynamics (SD) simulation model. A \\nsimulation-based optimisation (SBO) framework which incorporates the \\ngenetic algorithm into the SD simulation model is then developed to identify the optimal values for the price per tonne of the product, desired \\ncash, profit distribution policy, and desired inventory levels at SC \\nmembers. The procedure for the SBO framework is elaborated in Section \\n4.2. It is worth mentioning that formulating the price of the product as a \\nvariable within the MILP model converts the MILP model into a non- \\nlinear model which significantly increases the computational time. \\nThe stocking capacities of the SC facilities would be more realistic if \\nobtained by the SBO model in which inventory dynamics is considered. \\nIn step 3, the price, the profit distribution policy, the desired cash, \\nand the desired inventories that are obtained from the SBO model are \\ninputted into the MILP model in which the new optimal values to the \\ndecision variables explained in step 1 are determined. Taking the results \\nof the second iteration from the MILP model, the SBO model is then run \\nagain to obtain a new solution containing the product price, the desired \\ncash, the profit distribution policy and the desired inventories at the SC \\nfacilities (step 4). \\nAt this point, the information gathered from the MILP-SBO model is \\nused to examine whether the current solution, which is the EVA of the \\nnetwork is higher than the EVA obtained in the previous run of the MILP- \\nSBO model. If the termination criterion is satisfied, the solution sug-\\ngested by the MILP-SBO approach is accepted, otherwise, the results are \\nused to revise the problem to be resolved by the MILP-SBO approach in \\nthe third iteration, and so on. The revision of the problem contains the \\nrevision of feasible intervals of the controllable parameters including \\nFig. 1.The structure of the studied SC.  \\nFig. 2.The MILP-SBO modelling.  E.

Objective function \\nThe economic profitability of the studied SC is measured by the \\neconomic value added (EVA) index. The EVA [51] is a widely used index \\nwhich integrates financial and economic performance indicators. This \\nindicator rectifies the optimistic interpretation of a company ’s perfor -\\nmance by deducting the cost of employed capital from its net income. \\nEconomic situation has a significant impact on the cost of employed \\ncapital. Therefore, in presence of economic uncertainty it is critical to \\nuse EVA rather than profitability which ignores the cost of employed \\ncapital. The formulation of the EVA is given in Eq. (1), where NOPAT is \\nthe net operating profit after tax reported in the income statement and \\nWACC is the weighted average cost of capital, a figure representing the \\nreal costs concerned with the sources of capital employed by the com-\\npany [52]. \\nEVA t\\x88̂T\\nt\\x881\\x89NOPAT t\\x00\\x85WACC t\\x86ICt\\x8a (1) \\nThe WACC (2) is the return needed to compensate capital providers, \\ni.e. creditors and stakeholders and is obtained by multiplying the cost of \\ndebt (CD) and cost of equity (CE) by their proportional weight and then \\ntaking the sum of the results. The cost of debt is the weighted average of \\nshort-term and long-term liabilities. The cost of equity is measured by \\nthe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) which contains three elements. \\nThe first element is the risk-free rate of interest (rft) which is the reward \\nfor placing capital in a risk-free asset such as government bonds. The \\nsecond element, the difference between the expected return of the stock \\nmarket (rmt) and (rft), is the reward for placing capital in an investment \\nwhich requires taking risks such as stock market bonds. The third \\nelement, the risk measure \\x85β\\x86is the amount of systematic risk present in \\nan asset. Invested capital (IC) (3) accumulates the amount of financing \\nfrom debt and equity. \\nWACC t\\x88⎢\\n⨀∮Et\\nICt\\x00\\nrft\\x87\\x00\\nrmt\\x00rft)\\nβ)\\n⎬⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎭⎪⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫\\nCost ofequity⎥\\n⨁⨀\\n\\x87⎢\\n⨀⨀⨀∮STL t\\x87LTL t\\nICt[STL t\\nTLtSTR t\\x87LTL t\\nTLtLTR t]\\n⎬⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎭⎪⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫⎫\\nCost ofdebt\\x851\\x00trt\\x86⎥\\n⨁⨁⨁⨀(2) E.

Simulation-based optimization (SBO) model \\nThe MILP model presented in the previous section ignores the dy-\\nnamics of the physical and financial flows including nonlinearities, de-\\nlays, and feedback loops that exist in the physical and financial flows. \\nConsidering these within the MILP model converts it into a non-linear \\nmodel and increases its computational time significantly. To identify \\noptimal values for the inventory and financial decision parameters in a \\nmore efficient way we present an SBO framework that integrates an SD \\nsimulation model and a Genetic algorithm (GA). \\n4.2.1. SD simulation model \\nThe SD simulation model considers the dynamics of the physical and \\nfinancial flows and therefore represents a more realistic view of these \\nflows in the studied SC. Fig. 3 illustrates the stock and flow diagram for \\nthe physical flow. It considers the dynamics of the physical flow from \\nthree perspectives: (1) delays in physical flow including distribution \\nlead time between raw material supplier and manufacturer, production \\nlead time at the manufacturer, distribution lead time between manu -\\nfacturer and distribution centre, and distribution lead times between \\ndistribution centre and retailers. All these parameters are set to 1 week; \\n(2) feedback loops such as material inventory control loop that modifies \\nthe material order quantity in line with the material inventory. The \\nhigher the material inventory, the lower the material order quantity; (3) \\nformulating non-linear relationships between the decision parameters \\nand variables by incorporating decision parameters into their corre -\\nsponding module. The decision parameters have been highlighted in \\nFig. 3. For instance, to calculate the raw material order, the gap between \\nthe desired and actual material inventory is divided by the material \\ninventory adjustment time (MIAT ). Inventory decision parameters for \\nthe retailers and the distributor including the desired inventory (DI), the \\ndesired supply line (DSL), the forecasting parameter for inventory \\nadjustment (α), and the forecasting parameter for supply line adjustment \\n(β) are added to their corresponding order quantity module. Production \\ndecision parameters including the minimum order processing time \\n(MOPT), safety stock coverage (SSC), inventory adjustment time (IAT), \\nmanufacturing cycle time (MCT), and WIP adjustment time (WIPAT) are \\nadded to the production module. Material decision parameters including \\nmaterial safety stock coverage (MSSC), minimum material inventory \\ncoverage (MMIC), and material inventory adjustment time (MIAT) are \\nincorporated into the material order quantity module. \\nFig. 4 shows the stock and flow diagram for the financial flow. \\nSimilar to Fig. 3, It considers the delays and feedback loops in the \\nfinancial flow. The delay in financial flow is payment lead time which is \\nset to 4 weeks. It also formulates non-linear relationships between the \\ndecision parameters and variables by incorporating financial decision \\nparameters into cash collection, cash payment, NOPAT, WACCC, and \\ninvested capital modules. These include unit production cost (UPC), \\ncollection policy (m), payment policy (n), desired cash (DC), profit dis-\\ntribution policy (PDP), new stock parameter (NSP), and sales price (SP). \\nSD simulation model cannot identify the optimal values of the inventory \\nand financial decision parameters as it is not an optimiser. To determine \\nthe optimal values of the inventory and financial decision parameters, \\nSD simulation needs to be integrated with an optimiser, e.g., the Genetic \\nAlgorithm (GA). This is explained in Section 4.2.2 . \\nThe Appendix provides stock and flow diagrams of the physical and \\nfinancial flows in which a detailed explanation of the non-linear re-\\nlationships between the decision parameters and variables, delays and \\nfeedback loops that exist in the physical and financial flows are given. \\nThe definition of the inventory and financial decision parameters are \\nalso provided in the Appendix. \\nSD simulation models need to be validated through validation tests. \\nThree validation tests including a model structure test, boundary E.

The model structure test evaluates \\nwhether the structure of the model matches the structure of the system \\nbeing modelled [53]. In our model, every element of the model has a \\nreal-world counterpart in the physical and financial flows of the studied \\nSC. The boundary adequacy test examines whether model boundaries \\nmatch the purpose for which the model is designed [53]. As the objec -\\ntive of our model is to maximize economic profitability (EVA) for the \\nstudied SC, all of the factors affecting the EVA have been included in the \\nmodel. The extreme condition test is used to show the robustness of our \\ndeveloped simulation model [54]. The extreme condition test assesses \\nwhether the model behaves appropriately according to its input values \\n[54]. For example, the demand for a product goes to zero when there is a \\nsignificant increase in the price [54]. In our developed model, EVA \\ngrows significantly when the sales price per unit of the product that is a model input increases dramatically. \\n4.2.2. The genetic algorithm (GA) \\nThe GA identifies the optimal values for the inventory and financial \\ndecision parameters in the SD simulation model. A detailed explanation \\nof GA is given in Streichert [55]. GAs do not require derivative infor-\\nmation found in analytical optimisation, but work well with numerically \\ngenerated data, possess the ability to jump out of local minimum, and \\nare able to optimise continuous and discrete parameters, particularly the \\ncontinuous parameters [56]. GA is a perfect fit for optimising the SD \\nsimulation model in this study as the inventory and financial decision \\nparameters that need to be optimised are continuous and the objective \\nfunction presented in Eq. (37) is not available in an explicit form and is \\nmeasured using the SD simulation model. \\nTo optimise SD models using GAs, each solution known as a \\nFig. 3.Stock and flow diagram of physical flow.  \\nFig. 4.Stock and flow diagram of financial flow.

A solution pool \\nnamed population is formed by a set of chromosomes. The algorithm \\nstarts with setting up a population of random possible solutions. In this \\nstudy, the random solutions are generated within the range of parame -\\nters defined by Eq. (38). The chromosomes are then evaluated based on \\nthe objective function to obtain the fitness of the solution. A fitness value \\nshows how good each solution is in satisfying an objective function. We \\nuse the mean of the EVA presented in Eq. (37) as the fitness function of \\nthe GA. Applying the rule of survival of the fittest, the strongest solutions \\nare selected from the population. We use the roulette wheel selection \\nmethod to select the strongest solutions. Subsequently, solutions with \\nhigher fitness are combined to produce new solutions by performing a \\ncrossover operator. These solutions are known as parent solutions. We \\nuse the single-point crossover method. To ensure maintaining variety in \\nthe overall population, new solutions may then be subjected to small \\nvariations from parent solutions called mutation operator. We use the \\nsingle-point mutation method. Each population then represents a gen-\\neration, and the process continues until predefined stopping criteria are \\nmet, such as convergence of fitness over generations or reaching the \\nmaximum number of generations (Lu et al., 2012). We set the stopping \\ncriteria to be 300 generations. \\nSimilar to the MILP model, the objective of the SBO model is to \\nmaximize the economic profitability of the studied SC that is measured \\nby the EVA index. The objective function (37) is formulated as maxi-\\nmizing the mean of the EVA over the simulation period. Maximizing \\nEVA is achieved by identifying the optimal values for the inventory and \\nfinancial decision parameters of the simulation model that have been \\nhighlighted in Figs. 3 and 4. The feasible intervals for inventory and \\nfinancial decision parameters are defined by Eq. (38). \\nObjective function BMax EVA\\x88Max μEVAWhere μEVA\\x88⋃T\\nt\\x880EVA\\nT(37) \\nDecision parameters: \\nαDCαR1CαR2CαR3CβDCβR1CβR2CβR3CmCnC\\nDDICDDSLCDCCIATCMIATCMSSCCMCTCMMICCMOPTCPDPCR1DIC\\nR1DSLCR2DICR2DSLCR3DICR3DSLCSPCNSPCTAORCUPCCWIPAT \\nSubject to: \\n0≼αDCαR1CαR2CαR3≼1C0≼βDCβR1CβR2CβR3≼1C0≼mCn≼1C0≼DDI\\n≼60C0≼R1DICR2DICR3DI  \\n≼30C0≼DDSL≼60C0≼R1DSLCR2DSLCR3DSL≼30C1≼IAT≼5C1\\n≼MIAT≼5C0≼MSSC≼2C\\n0≼SSC≼2C0≼MMIC≼5C1≼MOPT≼3C0≼PDP≼1C200≼SP\\n≼300C0≼NSP≼1C\\n80≼UPC≼120C1≼WIPAT≼5C0≼DC≼2000C1≼MCT≼3(38) \\nSBO is a modelling framework which incorporates an optimisation \\nalgorithm into a simulation model to determine the optimal simulation \\nparameters configuration [57]. In SBO, the optimisation objective \\nfunction is estimated using a simulation model [44]. The framework of \\nthe SBO is shown in Fig. 5. SBO is an iterative process which is launched \\nby an optimization algorithm, i.e., GA that generates the initial values to \\nthe inventory and financial decisions parameters within the ranges \\ndefined by Eq. (38). The simulation model is then run using the gener -\\nated values to evaluate system performance, i.e., mean of the EVA pre-\\nsented in Eq. (37). Thereafter, the performance measures are fed back \\ninto the optimization algorithm. Based on this feedback a new set of \\ninventory and financial decision parameters are generated and inputted \\ninto the simulation model for evaluation [58]. This iterative process continues until a user-specified stop criterion such as performing a \\ndefined number of evaluations or the maximum number of generations \\nis met [59]. We set the stopping criteria to be 300 generations. \\n4.3. MILP-SBO modelling \\nThe MILP-SBO approach seeks to utilize the advantages of both MILP \\nand SBO models. In the MILP-SBO framework, the decisions recom -\\nmended by the MILP model and the decisions that are obtained by the \\nbalancing loops in the SD simulation model are integrated to determine \\nthe amount of raw material to be purchased, the production start rate \\nand the shipment rates across the network. The material delivery rate \\n(39) in this model is a function of the desired material order rate from \\nthe SD model and the material order rate from the MILP model. The \\nproduction start rate (40) is determined by the desired production rate \\nand the feasible production from the material determined by the SD \\nmodel and the production rate recommended by the MILP model. The \\nshipment rate of the manufacturer (MSR d)(41) is determined by the \\nmaximum shipment rate to each distributor, the desired shipment rate of \\neach distributor, and the shipment rate suggested by the MILP model. \\nThe amount of products that are shipped from each distribution centre to \\neach retailer (DSR dr) (42) is a function of the desired shipment rate of the \\ndistributor determined by the MILP model and the maximum shipment \\nrate and the inventory of the distributor that are obtained from the SD \\nmodel. The sale rate of each retailer (RSR r) (43) is calculated by its \\ncustomer demand, its inventory level, and the sale rate obtained from \\nthe MILP model. Employing the optimal decision variables determined \\nby the MILP model to decide on decision variables in the SD model re-\\nduces the levels of inventory held by SC members and the level of cash \\nheld at SC. \\nMaterial order rate\\x88Min⌊\\nDesired material order rateĈS\\ns\\x881Xst⌋\\n(39)  \\nProduction start rate\\x88Min\\x85Desired production start rateC\\nFeasible production from materialCPR t\\x86(40)  \\nMSR d\\x88Min\\x85Maximum shipment rate dCDesired shipemnt rate dCSCdt\\x86⊥dB\\n(41)  \\nDSR dr\\x88Min\\x85Retailer order rCDistributor inventory dCSDI drt\\x86⊥rCdB (42)  \\nRSR r\\x88Min\\x85drtCRetailer Inventory rCSRrt\\x86⊥rB (43)  \\n5.A case study \\nThe advantages of the MILP-SBO modelling are investigated by \\ncomparing it with the individual optimization and SBO methods through \\nconducting empirical tests.

Tables 2 and 3 present the \\nproduction, inventory holding, and cash holding costs in each period. \\nThe transportation costs from suppliers to the production centre, from \\nthe production centre to distributors, and from distribution centres to \\nthe retailers are given in Tables 4–6, respectively. Tables 7 and 8 show \\nthe five parameters that represent economic uncertainty. Three sce-\\nnarios are defined to reflect the uncertainties in five economic param -\\neters including customer demand, expected return of the market, risk- \\nfree rate of interest, short-term interest rate, and long-term interest \\nrate. It is assumed that in the first period, there is no economic uncer -\\ntainty but at the start of the second period, there are three potential \\nconditions including boom, stagnation, and, recession and these lead to \\nthree scenarios. During a boom period, economic prosperity leads to the \\nincreased purchasing power of customers which results in excessive \\ndemand for products and services. The expected return of the market \\nrises, as the investors who are optimistic about the future of the com-\\npanies present in the stock market increase their investment. The risk- \\nfree rate of interest, which is usually the interest rate of a govern -\\nmental bond, falls as the risk of default diminishes. The risk of the \\nborrower ’s default decreases, therefore financial institutions charge \\nlower short-term and long-term interest rates. On the other hand, during \\na recession period, the aforementioned parameters move in the opposite \\ndirection. In a stagnation period, it is assumed that the past shapes the \\nfuture because there are minor deviations in the value of parameters \\ncomparing the preceding period [26]. \\nThe sales price of the product and production capacity in each period \\nare presented in Table 9. Three models are developed based on opti-\\nmization (MILP), SBO, and MILP-SBO methods. The results of each \\nmodel are analysed and presented in the following sections. \\n5.1. Optimization model (MILP) \\nThe values of the parameters in the optimization model (MILP) are \\nrandomly generated in the feasible interval of the parameter values \\nusing MATLAB software. For instance, to determine the unit production \\ncost of the product in each period, two random data in the interval of \\n[58–62] were generated. The MILP model focuses on identifying long- \\nterm decisions such as SC structure. Therefore, the material delivery \\nand cash payment lead times are assumed to be zero; otherwise, the \\nsolving period must be subdivided into shorter periods, in this model \\nweeks, to accommodate the lead times. Neglecting the lead times in \\nmaterial delivery and assuming zero safety stock, the MILP model rec-\\nommends keeping no inventory at all with the SC members. Therefore, \\nthe EVA obtained from the MILP model is higher than the one gained \\nfrom the SBO and MILP-SBO models that hold inventory, including \\nfinished goods and raw material. To establish a meaningful contrast \\nbetween the MILP, SBO and MILP-SBO models, we assume that the SC \\nmembers hold safety stock to hedge against the demand uncertainty. \\nThis reduces the EVA obtained from the MILP model compared to the \\ncase with zero safety stock. The MILP model is then used to determine \\nthe optimal network design and the production rates at the production \\ncentre. The computational time of the MILP model is low, less than 10 s, \\nas it does not formulate the cash and inventory dynamics. Considering \\nthese converts the MILP model into a mixed integer non-linear pro-\\ngramming model (MINLP) and significantly increases the computational \\ntime. As Table 10 shows the storage locations and the supplier deter -\\nmined by the MILP model for each scenario. Considering the possible economic conditions at the start of the second year, the MILP model \\nsuggests purchasing the raw material from supplier no. 1 and to open \\nDistribution centre no. 2. \\nTable 11 illustrates the MILP model results for some physical and \\nfinancial variables in each scenario. Demand variability is caused by the \\neconomic uncertainty driving the production rate. Demand growth in \\nscenario 1, is adjusted by increasing the production rate, while the de-\\nmand shrinkage in scenario 3 is dealt through decreasing the production \\nrate. In scenario 2, the MILP model recommends diminishing the pro-\\nduction rate at year two, although the customer ’s demand has remained \\nunchanged. The reason is that the demand is partially met by the safety \\nstock. The equality of the right and left sides of the balance sheet in each \\nperiod shows the accuracy of the financial modelling. The profitability, \\nNOPAT, and the economic performance, EVA, of the chain decrease \\nwhen the economy diminishes in size as increasing cost of goods sold is \\nnot offset by neither demand growth nor reduction in financing ex-\\npenses, i.e., cost of equity and cost of debt. \\nThe structure of the current assets in each year for the three scenarios \\nis illustrated in Fig. 6. In all scenarios at the end of the second year the \\nhighest and lowest shares of the current assets belong to the cash and \\ninventory values, respectively. The inventory level at the end of the \\nsecond year for all scenarios is similar and is equal to the safety stock, \\ndespite the demand differences.

The MILP model in all three sce-\\nnarios recommends using long-term liabilities as the source of financing \\ndue to its lower interest rates compared to short-term liabilities and \\nissuing new stocks. The growth of equity at the second year for all sce-\\nnarios is triggered by the addition to retained earnings which is set to be \\n45 percent of the NOPAT. \\n5.2. MILP, SBO and MILP-SBO models \\nAs explained in Section 4.3, the SBO model is constructed by incor -\\nporating genetic algorithms into the SD simulation model to identify the \\noptimal values for the inventory and financial decision parameters of the \\nsimulation model that maximize the objective function, EVA. The pa-\\nrameters of the GA including the population size, crossover rate, and \\nmutation rate are set to be 300, 0.8, and 0.1, respectively. The simula -\\ntion time step is one week. The MILP-SBO model uses the optimal de-\\ncision variables determined by the MILP model to decide on the quantity \\nof the order to be placed with the suppliers, the production rate at the \\nmanufacturing site, and the shipment rates in the SC network. We also \\ncompare the performance of the MILP-SBO model with the MILP method \\nproposed in the literature (e.g., [5,12]). \\nThe MILP model was implemented in GAMS (25.1.1 ver.) and solved \\nusing CPLEX (12.8.0.0 ver.) solver, and the SBO simulation model was \\nimplemented in MATLAB (2021a ver.). All models run in an Intel(R) \\nCore(TM) CPU i7–10610U @2.60 GHz with 32GB RAM. \\n5.2.1. Scenario 1 \\nScenario 1 assumes a boom in the second year of the simulation that \\nincreases customer demand and expected return of the market and a \\ndecrease in risk-free rate of interest, short-term interest rate and long- \\nterm interest rate. In terms of computational time, there is no consid -\\nerable difference between the SBO and MILP-SBO models as both models \\nconsider the inventory and cash dynamics. The inventory and cash dy-\\nnamics for the members in scenario 1 obtained from the SBO and MILP- \\nSBO models are illustrated in Figs. 8(a)-(d) and 9(a)-(d), respectively. \\nThe MILP-SBO approach is more efficient than the SBO approach in \\nmanaging the cash and inventory of the SC members as it uses the \\noptimal values for the raw material order quantity, production rate, and Table 8 \\nMacroeconomic parameters values in the predicted economic scenarios.  \\nScenario Parameter  \\nSTR\\x89s\\x8a\\nt\\x880 STR\\x89s\\x8a\\nt\\x8853 LTR\\x89s\\x8a\\nt\\x880 LTR\\x89s\\x8a\\nt\\x8853 r\\x89s\\x8a\\nft\\x880 r\\x89s\\x8a\\nft\\x8853 r\\x89s\\x8a\\nmt\\x880 r\\x89s\\x8a\\nmt\\x8853 \\nS1 7.00 5.60 4.00 3.00 2.50 2.00 5.00 6.00 \\nS2 7.00 7.00 4.00 4.00 2.50 2.50 5.00 5.00 \\nS3 7.00 8.40 4.00 5.00 2.50 3.00 5.00 4.00  \\nTable 9 \\nSale price and production capacity.  \\nSales price (pri)(GBP/Ton) Production capacity (prcap) (Tons of products) \\nt \\x881 t\\x882 t\\x881 t\\x882 \\n235.6 270.94 2500 2500  \\nTable 10 \\nOptimal storage locations and supplier selection by the MILP model under scenario 1, 2, and 3.  \\nDecision variables Suppliers Distribution centres  \\nS1 S2 DC 1 DC 2 DC 3 \\nOpen/Close \\nOpen\\x881 \\nClose\\x880 t\\x881 t\\x882 t\\x881 t\\x882 t\\x881 t\\x882 t\\x881 t\\x882 t\\x881 t\\x882 \\n1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0  Table 11 \\nOptimal values to the physical and financial flow variables.  \\nDecision \\nvariables Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3  \\nt\\x881 t\\x882 t\\x881 t\\x882 t\\x881 t\\x882 \\nPR 2227.2 2500 2227.2 1890 2227.2 1207 \\nSC 2027.2 2660 2027.2 2050 2027.2 1367 \\nSDI 2007.2 2660 2007.2 2050 2027.2 1367 \\nSR 2007.2 2660 2007.2 2050 2027.2 1367 \\nFA\\x87CA 720,200 768,971 720,200 743,099 720,200 720,261 \\nLTL\\x87\\nSTL\\x87E 720,200 768,971 720,200 743,099 720,200 720,261 \\nNOPAT 22,222 87,475 22,222 58,999 22,222 33,623 \\nEVA 38,779 7023 \\x0026,187  \\nFig. 6.Current assets structure.  \\nFig. 7.Capital structure.

Both the inventory peaks and the \\noscillation in inventory ranges for SC members fall after using the MILP- \\nSBO approach. Moreover, the inflow and outflow of cash in the MILP- \\nSBO model are lower than the ones from the SBO model. Lower in-\\nventory and cash levels in the MILP-SBO model yield lower inventory and cash costs compared to the SBO model. Consequently, the EVA of \\nthe SC obtained from the MILP-SBO model, £38,045, is 16% higher than \\nthe EVA obtained from the SBO model, £32,840.

These parameters are then inputted into the MILP, SBO, and \\nMILP-SBO models and the EVA of each realisation for each model is \\ncalculated. Table 12 reports the EVAs obtained from all models for each \\nrealisation. The mean of the EVAs obtained from the MILP model is 17% \\nand 1.2% higher than the SBO and MILP-SBO models, respectively. The \\nreason for this is that the MILP model does not consider the inventory \\nand cash dynamics in the SC as opposed to the SBO and MILP-SBO \\nmodels. Therefore, the recommended cash and inventory levels at SC \\nmembers by the MILP model is lower than the recommended levels by \\nthe SBO and MILP-SBO models. The standard deviation of the EVAs \\nobtained from the MILP-SBO model is 61% and 95% lower than the SBO \\nand MILP models, respectively. This shows that the MILP-SBO model is \\nmore robust to changes in macroeconomic parameters than the SBO and \\nMILP models. The reason for this is that the MILP-SBO model identifies \\nthe optimal values of the inventory and financial decision parameters \\nshown in Eq. (38) and it uses the minimum function to ensure the \\nfeasibility of production and distribution values shown in Eq. (39)-(43). \\nWhile the SBO only determines the optimal values of the inventory and \\nfinancial decision parameters, and the MILP only identifies the optimal \\nvalues of the production and distribution values without considering SC \\ndynamics in the physical and financial flows. \\n5.2.2. Scenario 2 \\nScenario 2 assumes stagnation in the second year of the simulation \\nthat results in stability in customer demand, expected return of the \\nmarket, risk-free rate of interest, short-term, and long-term interest \\nrates. The inventory and cash dynamics for the members in scenario 2 \\nobtained from the SBO and MILP-SBO models are illustrated in Figs. 10 \\n(a)-(d) and 11(a)-(d), respectively. The performance of the MILP-SBO \\napproach in decreasing the inventory levels for the retailers and \\ndistributor is not noticeably better than the SBO performance, as there is \\nstability in customer demands. Using the MILP-SBO approach leads to a \\nsignificant reduction in the inventory levels for the manufacturer. The \\ninventory of the manufacturer in the MILP-SBO model from week 30 \\nuntil the end of the simulation fluctuates in the range of [30,60] tonnes \\nof product, while the inventory value at the same period in the SBO \\nmodel remains stable at the level of 92 tonnes of product. Although the \\nMILP-SBO approach does not significantly reduce the gap between the \\ncash inflow and cash outflow, the number of weeks in which the cash \\noutflow outstrips the cash inflow in the MILP-SBO model are 40 weeks, \\nweeks 20 to 60, more than the SBO model that results in the lower cash \\ncosts in the MILP-SBO model compared to the SBO model. Lower in-\\nventory levels at the manufacturer and the cash held in the SC in the \\nMILP-SBO model yield lower inventory and cash costs compared to the \\nSBO model. Consequently, the EVA of the SC obtained from the MILP- \\nSBO model, £6849, is 14% higher than the EVA obtained from the \\nSBO model, £6008. Table 13 reports the EVAs obtained from each model \\nby changing the values of macroeconomic parameters reported in the \\nrange of [\\x0015%, \\x8715%]. These parameters are then inputted into the MILP, SBO, and MILP-SBO models and the EVA of each realisation for \\neach model is calculated. The mean of the EVAs obtained from the MILP \\nmodel is 16% and 2.6% higher than the SBO and MILP-SBO models, \\nrespectively. Similar to scenario 1, this is because the MILP model does \\nnot consider the inventory and cash dynamics and therefore, the rec-\\nommended cash and inventory levels at SC members by the MILP model \\nare lower than the levels recommended by the SBO and MILP-SBO \\nmodels. The standard deviation of the EVAs obtained from the MILP- \\nSBO model is 36% and 90% lower than the SBO and MILP models, \\nrespectively. This shows that the MILP-SBO model is more robust to \\nchanges in microeconomic parameters than the SBO and MILP-SBO \\nmodels. Similar to scenario 1 this is because the MIP model ignores SC \\ndynamics in the physical and financial flows and the SBO only de-\\ntermines the optimal values of the inventory and financial decision pa-\\nrameters. While the MILP-SBO model identifies the optimal values of the \\ninventory and financial decision parameters shown in Eq. (38) and it \\nuses the minimum function to ensure the feasibility of production and \\ndistribution values shown in Eq. (39)-(43). \\n5.2.3. Scenario 3 \\nScenario 3 assumes recession in the second year of the simulation \\nthat results in a decrease in customer demand and expected return of the \\nmarket and an increase in the risk-free rate of interest, short-term and \\nlong-term interest rate. The inventory and cash dynamics for the \\nmembers in scenario 3 obtained from the SBO and MILP-SBO models are \\nillustrated in Figs. 12(a)-(d) and 13(a)-(d), respectively. \\nCompared to the SBO model, the MILP-SBO approach does not \\nsignificantly diminish the inventory levels for the SC members. How-\\never, it reduces the oscillations in the inventory levels of the members. \\nAs in scenario 2, the gap between the cash inflow and cash outflow in the \\nMILP-SBO model is not significantly lower than the one in the SBO \\nmodel, while the number of weeks in which the cash outflow outstrips \\nthe cash inflow in the MILP-SBO model is 30 weeks, weeks 20 to 50, \\nmore than the SBO model. This results in lower cash costs in the MILP- \\nSBO model compared to the SBO model. Consequently, the EVA of the \\nSC obtained from the MILP-SBO model, £\\x0026,657, is 6.18% higher than \\nthe EVA obtained from the SBO model, £\\x0028,414. \\nTable 14 reports the EVAs obtained from each model by changing the \\nvalues of macroeconomic parameters reported in Table 8 in the range of \\n[\\x0015%, \\x8715%]. The mean of the EVAs obtained from the MILP model is \\n8% and 1.3% higher than the SBO and MILP-SBO models, respectively. \\nSimilar to scenarios 1 and 2, this is because the recommended cash and \\ninventory levels by the MILP model is lower than the levels recom -\\nmended by the SBO and MILP-SBO models. The standard deviation of \\nthe EVAs obtained from the MILP-SBO model is 49% and 69% lower \\nthan the SBO and MILP models, respectively. This shows that the MILP- \\nSBO model is more robust to changes in microeconomic parameters than \\nthe SBO and MILP-SBO models. This is explained by the same reason \\ngiven in scenarios 1 and 2. \\nTable 15 shows the number of iterations performed to meet the \\nstopping criterion, which is no improvement in the value of the EVA \\nobtained from the MILP-SBO model, in each scenario. For each iteration \\nin each scenario, the GA was run 15 times. The results are reported in \\nTable 16. The results indicate the maximum stopping iterations of three \\nin scenario 1 and two in scenarios 2 and 3. Although, it is not feasible to \\nprove the rapid convergence of the EVAs obtained from the MILP-SBO \\nmodel for all the test results as the GA is a stochastic search algo-\\nrithm. The results of the comparison between the values of the EVA \\nobtained from the MILP-SBO model and the values obtained from the \\nMILP and SBO models are shown in Table 16. The MILP-SBO approach \\noutperforms the SBO approach as it decreases the levels of cash and \\ninventory in SC. \\n6.Concluding discussion \\nIntegrating SC finance into SC planning is critical as it ensures the Table 12 \\nSensitivity analysis on the models in scenario 1.  \\nNo. of realisation MILP model SBO model MILP-SBO model \\n1 39,964 32,893 37,993 \\n2 39,626 32,901 37,870 \\n3 39,979 32,667 37,953 \\n4 37,070 32,574 37,922 \\n5 38,070 32,543 38,003 \\n6 37,651 32,750 38,074 \\n7 37,565 32,808 37,904 \\n8 40,123 32,984 38,016 \\n9 37,235 33,111 37,919 \\n10 37,061 32,703 38,068 \\nMean 38,434.4 32,793.4 37,972.2 \\nStandard deviation 1252.41 163.97 62.99  E.

MILP models help to identify the \\noptimal values for the strategic and tactical decisions, while they ignore \\nthe nonlinearities, feedback loops and delays that exist in the physical \\nand financial flows of the SCs. SBO models take into account the non-\\nlinearities, feedback loops, and delays exist in the physical and financial \\nflows of the SCs, while they cannot identify the optimal values for the \\nstrategic and tactical decisions such as the structure of the SC. MILP-SBO \\nmodelling is an effective tool for addressing the SC planning and finance \\nproblem as it can efficiently capture nonlinearities, delays, and feedback \\nloops that exist in physical and financial flows of the SCs and is also able \\nto identify the optimal values for the strategic and tactical decisions.

The proposed model aims \\nto maximize the EVA generated in an SC and deals with economic un-\\ncertainty by considering three predicted economic scenarios. \\n6.1. Theoretical contributions \\nThis paper contributes to two research domains: SC planning and \\nfinance, and simulation-optimization modelling for SC management. SC \\nplanning and finance models (e.g., [15–17,19,25]) are mostly optimization models, i.e., MILP, that ignore the uncertainties in mac-\\nroeconomic parameters. To address this gap in the literature, we \\ndeveloped a simulation-optimization model in this study that considers \\nthe uncertainties in four macroeconomic parameters including \\nshort-term interest rate, long-term interest rate, expected return of the \\nstock market, and the risk-free rate of interest in addition to the un-\\ncertainty in one microeconomic parameter, i.e., demand. \\nSimulation-optimization models that have been developed for address -\\ning SC problems (e.g., [36,38–40,42,45]) predominantly applied \\ndiscrete-event simulation (DES) as the simulation approach and ignored \\nthe flow of funds within SC networks. Moreover, these models solely \\noptimized the decision parameters of the simulation models and do not \\nprovide the optimal values to the decision variables of the simulation \\nmodels. To address this gap in the literature, the developed model in this \\nstudy integrates planning of the financial and physical flows within SC \\nnetworks through combining an optimization model, i.e., MILP, and a \\nsimulation-based optimization model that includes a system dynamics \\nsimulation model and a genetic algorithm. The developed MILP-SBO \\nmodel identifies the optimal values for the decision variables of the \\nsimulation model such as the flow of products amongst SC members and \\nproduction rate in addition to the optimal values for the decision pa-\\nrameters of the simulation model such as policies on payables and re-\\nceivables. To demonstrate the feasibility of the developed \\nsimulation-optimization approach, it is applied to address an inte-\\ngrated supplier selection, network design, production and inventory \\nplanning, and asset-liability planning problem in an SC system. \\nThe presented approach is initialized by solving the MILP model to \\ndetermine the optimal values for the amount of raw material required to \\nbe purchased from the suppliers, the production rate at the \\nmanufacturing site, and the flow of finished products between the SC \\nmembers considering the existing constraints in the financial and \\nphysical flows. The solution suggested by the MILP model is then used to \\nconstruct the SBO model that formulates the distribution and payment \\nlead times, the feedback loops, and nonlinearities rooted in an SC \\nnetwork. Thereafter, the embedded GA in the SBO model is run to \\nidentify the optimal values for the price per tonne of the product, the Table 13 \\nSensitivity analysis on the models in scenario 2.  \\nNo. of realisation MILP model SBO model MILP-SBO model \\n1 6850 6047 6834 \\n2 6946 6068 6829 \\n3 7090 6007 6851 \\n4 6844 6016 6855 \\n5 6908 6009 6853 \\n6 7180 6047 6853 \\n7 7057 6050 6820 \\n8 6923 6040 6851 \\n9 7187 6015 6823 \\n10 7193 6058 6829 \\nMean 7017.8 6035.7 6839.8 \\nStandard deviation 133.02 19.93 12.69  \\nFig. 12.Inventory and cash dynamics for the SC members in scenario 3 obtained from the SBO model.

In the next stage, the constraints of the optimization \\nproblem are revised in accordance with the optimal parameter values recommended by the SBO model and the optimization problem is run to \\ngenerate a new set of parameter values to be inputted into the SBO \\nmodel. The iterative process between the MILP and SBO models con-\\ntinues until the stopping criterion which is no improvement in the value \\nof EVA is met. The MILP-SBO approach enables the modeller to not only \\ntake into account the lead times, feedback loops, and nonlinearities \\nwhich exist in the SC physical and financial flows, but also dramatically \\nbridges the gap between the desired EVA, the EVA obtained from the \\nMILP model, and the real EVA, the EVA gained from the SBO model. \\nThe performance of the MILP-SBO model in maximizing the EVA is \\ncompared with the performances of the SBO model under three eco-\\nnomic scenarios.

The MILP-SBO significantly \\nreduced the inventory levels for the SC members and the cash held in the \\nSC. Moreover, the EVA of the SC increased by almost 16% from £32,840 \\nto £38,045.

The MILP-SBO significantly reduced the inventory levels \\nat the manufacturer and the cash held in the SC. The EVA of the SC \\nincreased by 14% from £6008 to £6849. The third scenario assumes \\nrecession at the second year of the simulation that results in a decrease in \\ncustomer demand and expected return of the market and increase in \\nrisk-free rate of interest, short-term and long-term interest rate. The \\ndifferences between the inventory levels of the SC members in SBO and \\nMILP-SBO models are negligible as a 50% reduction in customer demand \\nat the second year makes holding high inventory levels unnecessary. \\nHowever, the MILP-SBO model reduces the oscillations in the inventory \\nlevels of the members. The EVA of the SC increased by 6% from \\n£\\x0028,414 to £\\x0026,657. The results of the sensitivity analysis on mac-\\nroeconomic parameters showed that the MILP-SBO model is more robust \\nto changes in microeconomic parameters than the SBO and MILP-SBO \\nmodels. \\n6.2. Managerial implications \\nBusinesses need to keep sufficient cash to meet their operations ex-\\npenses such as buying raw material and also pay dividends to their in-\\nvestors. The higher the cash level held by a business, the lower the \\npossibility of the business ’ inability in meeting operations expenses and \\npaying dividends. Although keeping a high cash level by a business \\nensures its capability in meeting operations expenses and paying divi-\\ndends, it imposes the cash opportunity cost on the business. In other \\nwords, the business is foregoing the return that would have been derived \\nby investing the cash in alternative options to holding it such as \\ninvesting the cash in the stock market. Therefore, managers need to \\nmake a trade-off between adequacy of cash for meeting business ex-\\npenses and minimizing the opportunity cost that the business incurs as a \\nresult of holding cash. This study helps the SC managers make this trade- off by considering cash holding cost as an element of the total cost of the \\nbusiness and ensuring the cash level of the business is minimized. \\nMoreover, SC managers can monitor the cash level in the SC and assess \\nthe impact of cash retention policies on SC profitability by running what- \\nif scenarios in the SBO model. \\nSCs are exposed to uncertainties in macroeconomic and microeco -\\nnomic parameters that may have significant impacts on their profit -\\nability. SC managers need to ensure that the impact of these \\nuncertainties is taken into account while measuring the profitability of \\ntheir SCs, otherwise the profitability of the SC may represent a \\nmisleading view of the financial health of the SC. To obtain a more ac-\\ncurate SC profit, in this study, the impacts of uncertainties in four \\nmacroeconomic parameters including short-term interest rate, long- \\nterm interest rate, expected return of the market, and risk-free rate of \\ninterest and uncertainty in one macroeconomic parameter that is de-\\nmand on SC profit are considered. \\n6.3. Limitations and future work \\nThe limitations of this work that need to be studied in the future \\nresearch are as follows. Firstly, this study only examines the use of MILP- \\nSBO approach to address an SC planning and finance problem. In future \\nresearch other integrated SC planning problems such as integrated \\nnetwork design, distribution and transportation planning could be \\nsolved using the MILP-SBO approach or other hybrid modelling ap-\\nproaches. Secondly, the simulation approach applied in this study is SD, \\nit would be interesting to investigate the capability of optimization-SBO \\nmodels that employ simulation models rather than SD in addressing SC \\nplanning problems. Finally, multi-objective optimization can also be \\nincorporated into the developed MILP-SBO model as an extension to the \\npresent study. \\nFig. 14.Detailed stock and flow diagram of the physical flow.

The initial value of the cash level is the sum of short-term and long-term liabilities. Retailers collect part of customers ’ order values in \\ncash, while the remaining part of the customer debt is accumulated in receivable accounts (RA) and is paid after dc weeks. The cash inflow (64) is \\ncalculated by aggregating the customers ’ cash payment and receivable accounts from dc weeks ago (65). The updated collection policy (um) (66) \\nwhich is a parameter between 0 and 1 indicates the amount of customers ’ order value that must be collected in cash and is calculated by adding the \\ncash adjustment to the original collection policy. The updated cash collection policy cannot exceed 1. Adjustment for cash (67) is calculated via \\nmultiplying cash gap percentage and the forecasting parameter for cash adjustment (γ) which represents the aggressiveness of the decision maker in \\nbridging the gap between the desired and current cash levels. The outflow of cash (68) is prompted by payment to the suppliers, repayment for short- \\nterm and long-term liabilities, investment for fixed assets, and the total cost. When the manufacturer places an order to his suppliers, he pays part of \\nthe order value in cash and the outstanding debt is paid after d1 weeks. The payment policy (n) that is a parameter between 0 and 1 shows the amount \\nof manufacturer ’s order value that must be paid in cash. The remaining part of the manufacturer ’s debt is accumulated in payable accounts (PA) and is \\npaid after d1 weeks (69). \\nd\\x85Cash\\x86\\nd\\x85t\\x86\\x88Cash inflow\\x00Cash outflow (63)  \\nCash inflow\\x88̂R\\nr\\x881umSRrpri\\x87RAoutflow (64)  \\nRAoutflow\\x88Delay\\x85RAinflowCdcCinitial value\\x86 (65)  \\num\\x88Min\\x85m\\x87CSAdjustmentC1\\x86 (66)  \\nCash Adjustment\\x88γ[Desired cash\\x00cash\\ncash]\\n(67)  \\nCash outflow\\x88̂S\\ns\\x881nXsSpri s\\x00PAoutflow\\x00STL payment\\x00LTL payment\\x00FAinvestment\\x00Total cost rate (68)  \\nPAoutflow\\x88Delay\\x85PAinflowCd1Cinitial value\\x86 (69)  \\nNOPAT and invested capital modules \\nThe total cost comprises the elements presented in Eq.

Security returns are considered to be random variables where there exist sufficient \\ndata of historical returns. Nonetheless, uncertain variables may be applied to increase the \\neffectiveness of security returns. The following research entails an optimization objective problem \\nfocusing on minimum lots of transaction in uncertain environments of dynamic trading. Also, the \\nchanging risk preference of the investor over the horizon of investment has been factored in the \\nmodel. An average- Value at Risk (VaR) framework has been used to maximize wealth creation \\nusing genetic algorithms.   \\n1.Introduction \\nPortfolio optimization is the optimal restructuring of different weights of securities, with the goal of balancing potential risks and \\nmaximizing expected returns. Markowitz put forward a classical average variance framework that has been used as the background of \\nquantitative analysis in portfolio optimization (Jaaman and Ramli, 2017 ). The mean-variance framework uses variance as a quantity of \\ninvestment risk while the investment return is quantified numerically. The variance metric was found to be sensitive given that it has \\nbeen controversial in investment analysis. Variance illustrates the deviation from expected returns, and is only crucial when it is below \\nthe expected returns while that above expected returns is considered non-essential. Variance offers less intuition inference to insti-\\ntutional investors and does not evaluate tolerance of risks accurately. Investors can easily quantify losses compared to the tolerable \\nvariance. Considering the above mentioned facts, other techniques of risk measures were assessed. \\nOne of these methods is the value-at-risk (VaR) technique postulated by Baumol (Prihatiningsih et al., 2020 ), a popular modern \\nmethod that is used to manage and measure risk. A wide range of portfolio optimization studies have been conducted using VaR. An \\noptimization model using average VaR was used to analyze the implication of economic arising (Alexander and Baptista, 2006 ). \\n(Baixauli et al., 2010 ) applied VaR to measure risks by using a framework with a non-linearity structure and minimum units of \\ntransaction. The model of portfolio optimization based on VaR while considering transaction costs was also undertaken by Sulem \\n(1997) . (Chacko et al. 2015) solved a static study of portfolio allocation, where VaR was used to control the risk of investment while \\nconsidering the maturity and validity of the optimization problem. The main research content of this paper is investment portfolio \\noptimization, which aims to optimize the asset allocation ratio in the investment portfolio over multiple periods to achieve maximum \\nreturn and reduce risk. This study has a certain promoting effect on the research of investment portfolio optimization, providing \\ninvestors with more scientific and effective investment methods, and has a certain significance for the development of the financial \\n*Corresponding author. \\nE-mail address: njjsmile@163.com (J.

Trading rules are therefore as essential as \\nrisk assessment in financial markets. The basic elements of the trading market include minimum lots of transaction and transaction \\ncosts, which are necessary for any model of portfolio optimization. Transaction costs are crucial for trading investments as they in-\\nfluence net investment returns directly. Also, the real finance market has a basic rule of trading, minimum transaction lots, and hence \\nsecurity holdings by investors are finely divisible. Rounds should be taken into consideration. Different securities have minimum lots of \\ntransaction that vary across different markets globally. Transaction lots, rounds or lots are basis quantities linked to specific securities. \\nThey are set stock exchange regulatory bodies to illustrate minimal units of trade security. In line of these applicable facts, researches \\nhave applied models of portfolio optimization that apply mixed-integer programming or single programming. Portfolio optimization \\nproblems with concave costs of transaction and minimal lots were based on absolute risk measures (Konno and Wijayanayake 2001 ). \\nExtra constraints of the capitalization of the market sector and cardinality constraints were used to evaluate transaction costs (Ramos \\net al., 2022 ). (Setiawan and Rosadi, 2019 ) analyzed frameworks of portfolio selection subject to minimum lots of transaction while \\nusing the conditional VaR. Branch, bound, and genetic algorithms have been used to solve optimization models that have integer \\nconstraints. \\nThe case of the multi-period has been used to reallocate wealth in many research studies (Cao, This study involves building a new \\nmodel for multi-period portfolio maximization using dynamic preference and minimum lots of transaction. The listed studies consider \\nportfolio optimization as a single-process framework that allocated the investment at the start of the period and hold on to it until the \\nclosure of the period. Practically, the process of investment ranges for a long term period for the investors, particularly for institutional \\ninvestments. Such multi-period frameworks have been extended using current constrains of trading, such as (Liu and Zhang 2020 ) who \\nused minimum lots of transaction to optimize portfolio problems. (Barati et al., 2016 ) considered minimum transaction costs and lots, \\nand modelled the optimization problems using average-semi variance. Genetic algorithms were linked to specific models of optimi -\\nzation similar to the single-period cases. \\nThe above models of multi-period portfolio optimization limit the risk preference of the investor to be constant over the entire \\nhorizon of investment. This presents a gap as investors track the fluctuations in the stock market constantly over the long-term in-\\nvestment horizon, which impact the risk preference that was determined by past investment results and attitudes of the human risk, \\nrather the static value over the horizon of investment. \\nThese studies are based on random environments, which constrain the amount of risk tolerance to a specific value. Moreover, the \\nexisting research studies on the dynamic index fail to provide meaningful insights to investors. (Karatzas & Zhao 2017) introduced the \\nadaptive factor of risk aversion to account for the rolling model of portfolio optimization. Also, (Lindquist et al., 2022 ) used the \\nchanging risk tolerance and expected levels of returns in a multi-facet portfolio modeling. In this model, the level security returns are \\nconsidered to be random variables. Adequate historical data have been used as a prerequisite for deriving probability distributions. \\nNonetheless, the models use historical data of uncertain variables to solve problems of portfolio optimization. The stream of existing \\nliterature indicates that single portfolio models have been analyzed extensively, while multi-period models have not been analyzed \\nextensively while taking into consideration the constrains of dynamic risk preferences and minimum lots of transaction. This \\nmulti-period model is an aggregate consideration of the uncovered uncertain variables. \\nThe contributions of this study in the area of portfolio optimization has its roots in the existing literature and comprise of the \\nfollowing aspects. This model provides meaningful insights to investors by building on previous models that failed to take into \\nconsideration the minimum lots of transaction and employing dynamic risk preferences. A multi-period average VaR model with \\nminimum lots of transaction for optimizing portfolio problems is initiated, whereby uncertain variables are used to capture inaccurate \\nestimations of security returns rates. The existing wealth is maximized using decision variables which reduces the computational \\ncomplexity of the formats of exponential functions. The dynamic framework of risk preference is then introduced given that investors \\nmay change their risk preference attitudes over the investment horizon. \\n3.Methodology \\nThe initial wealth of the investor at the beginning of the period is W1. The investment involves the allocation of W1 amongst a \\nnumber of n risky assets and a risk-free rate at the beginning of the period, t-1, and the acquisition of the final wealth after a period of T. \\n3.1.

Monte Carlo and back testing simulations \\nBack-testing is used to evaluate the performances of trading strategies. This technique involves running through historical data at \\neach time horizon to make appropriate trade decisions. The emerging outcomes in each of the period is used for analysis. Back-testing \\nis based on the idea that past trends determine future trends. This is however not always the case and could bias the results. In this case, \\nthe back test process on simulated history data is applied. The simulations are stochastic in nature, and hence the need of back test runs \\nthrough a Monte Carlo simulation to generate reliable assessments. \\n4.Back test procedure \\nFig. 1 illustrates the procedures of running the back-test. The presented closed form of solutions is less computational as the pa-\\nrameters and solution estimates require heavy computations of matrices. The estimated parameters are fixed along back tests. Also, a \\nspecific amount of noise is added to the estimates during the generation of synthetic data. Noise was added to different parameters \\nduring the generation of excess returns. \\n4.1. Transaction costs \\nGiven that decision variables of strategies of investment are represented by weights, the transaction costs of the market are defined \\nas follows: \\nTC 1\\x85u1\\x86\\x88a1†u1†\\x87b1†u1†1B5\\x87c1U12(5a)  \\nTC 2\\x85u2\\x86\\x88a2†u2†\\x87b2†u2†1B5\\x87c2u22(6)  \\nTC\\x85u\\x86\\x88TC\\x85u1\\x86\\x87TC\\x85u2\\x86 (7) \\nU illustrates the normalized trade on each of the assets. The two assets have the same properties which implies that a1–––a2, b1–––b2, \\nand that c1–––c2. In the normalized trades, quadratic and super linear coefficients of transaction b and c, depends on the aggregate \\nwealth but the parameters can be adjusted by the investor as leverage is allowed. \\nThe transaction costs are quadratic given that there exist no spill-over effects. This can be described as: \\nA\\x88λ10C0λ2 (8) \\nThe coefficients λ1 and λ2 are evaluated by approximating transaction costs and solving the minimization problem below: \\nMinλifu εJ\\x85TCi\\x85u\\x86\\x001E2λiu2\\x862duCi\\x881C2 (9) \\nWhere J is the region of trading where the normalized u trades fall under. The problems of minimization involves reducing the \\nsquared error between estimated quadratic costs and costs of market transaction, while taking into consideration that normalized \\ntrades are distributed uniformly over J. The optimization problem can be minimized as follows: \\nΛi\\x88fuεJ2u2TCi\\x85u\\x86duEfuεJu4duCi\\x881C2 (10)  Y.

In each of \\nthe approaches, taking into consideration the proposed returns of the generation model, different strategies were used to assess the \\naspect of return predictability. \\n4.3. Dynamic trading (DT) \\nThe following strategies will be used to test the model further.

Single models of portfolio optimization do not address portfolio management critical \\nconcerns, such as costs of transaction and taxes, evolving return dynamics of securities, and the trade-off between short term and long- \\nterm benefits. Given that there exist no cash flows that are intermediate such as expenditure and savings, a generic model for solving \\noptimization problems is maximized. \\n5.Assumptions discussions \\nOverall, our assumptions are in six dimension:  \\n1 Normal distribution of the assets.  \\n2 Trading of the assets can only be undertaken at discrete time intervals.  \\n3 The volatility is based on historical returns.  \\n4 The risk preferences of investors change based on the conditions, and follow pre-determined patterns.  \\n5 The objective of the investor is to maximize the risk-adjusted returns across different periods.  \\n6 The portfolio is balanced constantly without taking into consideration taxes in decision-making. All the assets are considered to be \\nindependent. \\n5.1. Evaluation and analysis metrics \\nThe common measures of performance measurement used in the evaluation of portfolios is the Sharpe ratio (Pav 2021 ).

Here, the weight is negative, indicating that the asset has been short sold. \\nExposure: The degree of exposure of the asset in the portfolio. Here, exposure is also negative, indicating that the exposure of the \\nasset is negative, meaning that if the market rises, the asset will perform even worse. \\nErp: The risk premium of the asset, i.e., the expected excess return.

Investment parameters \\nThe parameter of risk aversion λ1 was constrained to 1 and kept constant through the back test analysis. ϼ, the discount parameter \\nset as 0.0002 to annualized at a 5% discount rate. In the dataset, there were a total of 60 observations. Statistical analysis revealed a \\nmoderate correlation of 0.61 between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The independent variable accounted for \\n37.33% of the variance in the dependent variable, and the adjusted R Square was 31.63%. The F statistic of the observations was 0.39 \\nwith a corresponding p-value of 0.856, indicating that the regression equation was not statistically significant. Additionally, the re-\\nsidual sum of squares was 26,000,361.6, and the total sum of squares was 26,930,865.3. The analysis is shown in Table 3. \\nAccording to the regression results, it can be seen that the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent \\nvariables is relatively weak, as indicated by an R-squared value of 0.373. In the coefficient table, only one independent variable, \\ntransaction costs, has a p-value less than 0.05, which means that only this variable has a significant impact on the dependent variable in \\na statistical sense. \\nThe analysis of the main factors affecting portfolio optimization is shown in Table 4. \\nThe major factors that influenced the optimization of the portfolio include dynamic trading (DT fp, transaction costs, gross Sharpe \\nratio, net Sharpe ratio, and VaR. Each of the variables had a p value of less than 0.05 which implies that there is high correlation \\nbetween the independent variables and the dependent variables. Therefore, the variables are statistically significant but caused by \\nchance. \\n6.2. Experiment parameters \\nThe length of the back test period comprise of 1000 periods that correspond to a period of 4 years. G controlled the amount of noise \\nadded to the parameters of profit generation and was to 15%. The noise was limited to ensure that metrics such as the Sharpe ratios \\nwould converge. The choice allowed the verification of sampled metrics that should be normally distributed for the Sharpe ratio as per \\nthe central theorem limits. The initial weights of the two assets and the initial factors of prediction were set to 0. \\n6.3. Convergence of Monte Carlo simulations \\nThe mean net Sharpe ratios converged with dynamic strategies of trading with the number of simulations. In the estimation of \\nparameters of transaction costs λ, the adopted interval J of the normalized trade was chosen to be (\\x001, 1) as trades fell constantly in the \\ninterval. 105 simulations generated a confidence level of 5.1 and an average squared error of 10\\x005. During the variation of the pa-\\nrameters, the simulations were constrained to 104 to increase the time of conducting the experiments, and a seeds sequence for random \\ngeneration was used to generate reliable observations. \\n6.4. Trading signals \\nThe trading signals of asset 1 in strategy DTf recorded lower magnitudes compared to the weights DTp and DTfp. \\n6.5. Performance of the strategies \\nThis proposed model is more effective in the utilization of the factor strengths, which include the speed of the mean reversion and \\nthe variance. Ideally, the strategy DTcom, test was better compared to MW comb, best and E6MW comb, best given the net Sharpe ratios. Also, \\na weight of α best was not put entirely on DTϼ. The combination of the best performing strategies assumes that α best generated for all the \\nstrategies was used to measure the amount of contributions that were allocated to each of the slow and fast factors of prediction. \\n6.6. Performance sensitivity \\nThe results of the analysis affirm that dynamic trading is superior and would generate better Sharpe ratios. DTfp is the best per-\\nforming strategy when varying the parameters of transaction costs. The Sharpe ratio also decreased as the transaction costs increased. \\nNonetheless, the decreases in performance was less aggressive for the strategies of dynamic trading compared to the MW strategies as \\nthe average holding period increased consistently. This model thus performs better through the utilization of strengths of the pre-\\ndicting factors regardless of the coefficients of transaction costs. \\nAn increase in cost coefficients increased the daily costs incurred and reduced the Sharpe ratios irrespective of the cost form of \\nmarket transactions. The strategies of the DTfp strategies are different based on the nature of the market costs. Costs of quadratic \\ntransactions are more constraining compared to the performance of costs of super-linear transactions. Also, the divergence between the \\ntrajectories of the gross and net Sharpe ratios increase by higher margins when varying linear and super linear coefficients a and b \\ncompared to varying c. Loss of performance increases when market transactions are not quadratic. Y.

This model generates a higher Sharpe ratio compared to the existing models and would maximize the returns of a specific \\nportfolio. The dynamic trading strategy generates better performance. The strengths, such as the mean speed of reversion showed \\nevidence of better performance. The results indicated that the prediction factors decreased in importance as the transaction costs \\nincreased. Dynamic trading strategies are the best. However, the loss of the observed performance increased as the cost of non- \\nquadratic costs rose; this could be explained by the errors of estimation that were assumed in the model. Future work can be \\nemployed to generate applicable scenarios and achieve accurate input estimates of the required framework. \\nDeclaration of Competing Interest \\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to \\ninfluence the work reported in this paper.

The new \\noptimization framework is formulated such that time-dependent variations in energy demand and renewable \\nenergy availability are accommodated, while unnecessary non-linearity and computational complexities are \\navoided. The simplicity in the optimization model with a proposed solution strategy enables the use of a \\nspreadsheet-based solver that adequately encapsulates the impact of renewable energy integration on fossil fuel- \\nbased energy generation and predicts economic sizes of energy storage units. The developed optimization model \\nalso allows economic trade-offs between capital investment and operation costs, which determines the cost- \\neffective operational profiles of energy supplies and its exchange through energy storage. To demonstrate the \\napplicability and effectiveness of the proposed optimization models, case studies are conducted to identify the \\nmost cost-effective energy generation and utilization of renewable energy through a storage unit for different \\nlevels of renewable energy use; for example, up to 40% and 20% wind and solar energy contributions, respec -\\ntively, are considered for summer and winter subject to constraints on the capacity or heat-to-power ratio of \\nconventional energy generators.   \\n1.Introduction \\nAchieving net zero by 2050 demands a rapid transition of the in-\\ndustrial and energy sectors, which requires the widespread imple -\\nmentation of all the available technologies that can reduce emissions. \\nThe 2050 net zero emissions scenario of the International Energy Agency \\n(IEA) predicts that among various measures and technologies, renew -\\nable energy, together with improving energy efficiency, will contribute \\nto approximately 50% of emissions reduction by 2030 [1]. In particular, \\nrenewable energy sources are central to cutting emissions in electricity \\nsupply for buildings, industry, and transport, as electricity supply from \\nwind and solar energy is projected to increase to between 75% and 90% \\nby 2050 [2]. \\nThe advancement of renewable technologies in the last two decades \\nwill increase the global contribution of renewable electricity supply by \\n60% by 2026, compared to 2020 levels [3]. In the last decade, the cost of \\nsolar photovoltaics and onshore wind have been reduced by 85% and \\n56%, respectively, representing a rapid decline in the cost of renewable \\nelectricity [4]. However, these rapid technical advances and cost re-\\nductions in renewable energy generation have not been accompanied by an equally rapid adoption; their adoption has only been gradual. \\nThe intermittent availability of renewable sources or inconsistent \\nthroughput in renewable energy supply is one of the main obstacles in \\naccelerating the adoption of renewable energy. In order to respond to \\nthese operational issues, numerous studies have attempted to develop \\nenergy storage technologies, including pumped hydro, batteries, ther-\\nmal energy storage, mechanical energy storage, that can be used along \\nwith renewable energy generation [5,6]. Energy storage is essential for \\nimproving the acceptability of renewable energy and its integrability to \\nconventional energy infrastructure [7]; it can compensate for the vari-\\nability of renewable energy generation and enables the management of \\nthe dynamic differences of energy demand and supply in distributed \\ngrids. \\nIn energy systems that employ renewable sources, energy storage \\nunits can improve economic gains and operational reliability. However, \\nthe complex dynamics and design interactions between energy demand \\nand operating characteristics of energy generation systems make the \\nsystematic integration of renewable energy sources into consumer en-\\nergy systems difficult. This is very different from traditional energy \\nsystems in which energy generation and utilization are typically \\ncentralized with relatively constant energy demand. \\n*Corresponding author. \\nE-mail address: jinkukkim@hanyang.ac.kr (J.-K.

These approaches can be used to systemati -\\ncally identify ways to improve energy efficiency and increase the cost- \\neffectiveness and utilization of renewable energy supply. System-wide \\nmethods enable the holistic judgment of key performance indicators, \\nfor example, energy efficiency and costs, and provide cost-effective \\nstrategies for the design, operation, and planning of energy systems \\n[8]. This system analysis is typically conducted with graphical tech-\\nniques or optimization methods. Energy surplus or deficit in energy \\nsystems is represented with graphic information, which is then sche-\\nmatically manipulated to identify bottlenecks in energy recovery. This \\ngraphical method is applied to the targeting of the minimum capacity for \\nenergy generators [9] and determine the sizes of thermal storage units \\n[10]. Time-dependent energy demand and supply are typically \\nexpressed with a multi-period modeling approach. Algebraic techniques \\nare further used for graphical methods, in which graphical data or in-\\nformation of energy flows are tabulated to find the matching of energy \\nsources and sinks or to systematically assess the accumulated energy \\nflows. De Lira Quaresma et al. [11] proposed an algorithmic procedure \\nto determine the most appropriate allocation of electricity sources to \\npower demand, subject to availability and batteries. Yong et al. [12] \\nproposed a targeting framework for the simultaneous supply of heating, \\ncooling, and power to an urban-industrial system in which multiple \\nheating and cooling grids are set up and a series of cascading algorithms \\nfor heat recovery, energy storage, and power generation are applied. \\nThese thermodynamic-based approaches can identify the most crit-\\nical or limiting elements (e.g., time or unit) for energy recovery or uti-\\nlization, which can effectively provide conceptual guidance for \\nremoving bottlenecks in energy systems [13]. However, graphic or \\nalgebraic methods are adequate to investigate a single objective, for \\nexample, maximum energy recovery or minimum utility requirement. It \\nis inherently difficult to use them to simultaneously evaluate two or \\nmore criteria or accommodate the design constraints of energy systems. \\nHowever, when renewable energy systems with energy storage are used \\nto supply energy for commercial and residential consumers, complex \\ndesign interactions between the exchange and storage of energy arise \\ndue to variable energy demand and time-dependent renewable energy \\navailability. Design methods based on mathematical optimization are \\nwidely employed to systematically consider the interactions of design \\nvariables and inconsistent energy transfer [14]. \\nOne of the main approaches in the application of optimization is the \\ndesign of energy systems based on the multiperiod modeling of energy flows, in which time-dependent changes in energy demand, supply, and \\naccumulated energy in storage units are expressed as constant or \\naverage values assumed during a particular period, for example, an \\nhour-by-hour profile for daily heating demand. Although very detailed \\ndynamics of energy systems are not fully considered, this framework is \\nuseful for reducing the mathematical complexity of modeling, as dy-\\nnamic simulations for solving differential equations can be avoided. \\nInteger or binary variables are typically introduced for the optimization \\nto reflect the selection of specific units or preference of design options \\nfor energy systems. Numerous applications based on multi-period opti-\\nmization have been observed for design and planning problems in in-\\ndustrial and commercial energy sectors, including the design and sizing \\nof a solar domestic thermal energy system [15], design of an energy \\nstorage for a combined heat and power (CHP)-based district heating \\nsystem [16], design and operation of a heat prosumer for district heating \\nsystems [17], operational optimization of a multiple heat \\npumped-network [18], and design of a thermal storage unit for the en-\\nergy management of a building that uses distributed renewable sources \\n[19]. Although multi-period optimization is commonly considered for \\nstudying the design and planning of energy systems, it consists of a large \\nnumber of decision variables with nonlinear relationships; hence, spe-\\ncialists or specialized software are required for the programming of its \\noptimization. These computational difficulties prevent the wider adop-\\ntion of this optimization approach in academia and industry. \\nThe other mathematics-oriented approach is the application of dy-\\nnamic simulation and optimization, which are widely used to under -\\nstand the transient behaviors of energy systems under different \\noperating modes and build cost-effective and robust control strategies. \\nThe time-dependent change in key design variables is formulated with \\ndifferential equations that consider hydrodynamic and energy transfer \\nphenomena. Dynamic modeling and simulation have been applied in \\nvarious areas of energy systems research, for example, using Simulink to \\nunderstand the dynamic characteristics of a building ’s heating network \\n[20], designing a local district heating network with the utilization of \\nwaste heat and renewable energy [21], and controlling \\nrenewable-integrated power systems for the enhancement of system \\nstability and resilience to variations in energy demand [22]. Numerical \\nmethods are necessary for solving dynamic models and, in general, \\nrequire considerable programming effort and high-capacity computa -\\ntional resources. Therefore, when dynamic models are employed to \\nanalyze energy systems, the operational investigation of energy devices \\nor their process control are the focus and system-wide optimization is \\noften limited.

[24] for the thermal \\nmodel of a heating network. \\nVarious optimization studies on the design and operation of com-\\nmercial and industrial energy systems have been carried out. However, \\ntechnical advances in optimization studies have been focused on dealing \\nwith design and operational complexity in energy management, which \\nconsiders more rigorous and detailed evaluation of characteristics of \\ncomponents or equipment. Although better understanding and insights \\non energy system management can be gained through managing \\ncomplexity, complex modeling and optimization frameworks require \\nexpertise in model building and specialized computer-aided tools. \\nHence, a generic and simple design methodology is proposed for the \\ndesign, sizing, and operational optimization of renewable-integrated \\nenergy systems. The simplicity of the proposed optimization model al-\\nlows it to be programmed in a spreadsheet; optimal solutions can be \\nobtained with a spreadsheet add-in solver, for example, Excel Solver ®, \\nwithout relying on any external high-performance solvers. The devel -\\noped model is based on multi-period formulation to represent variations \\nin energy demand and supply. The optimization is developed to support \\ndecision-making for the design and operation of renewable-integrated \\nenergy systems; it can be used to systematically identify the most \\nappropriate levels of energy generation and renewable supply, subject to \\nenergy accumulation and its use in the energy storage. \\nThe next section describes an optimization model. This is then fol-\\nlowed by two case studies that demonstrate the applicability and use-\\nfulness of the optimization framework. Various scenarios are considered to illustrate how the proposed model can be applied in practice, which \\ncan provide guidance and strategies for the integration of renewable \\nenergy with sources used by energy consumers. \\n2.Optimization framework \\nThe study focuses on the development of a design and operation \\nframework for energy consumers when renewable energy is integrated \\nwith conventional energy supply systems. It considers two energy sys-\\ntems, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the flows of heat \\nand electricity of energy consumers. Thermal energy storage (TES) or \\nElectricity storage (ES) is employed for load-balancing and peak-shaving \\nof energy supply under variable energy demand. \\nOptimization models are proposed for the design and sizing of energy \\ngenerators and storage when renewable heat and electricity is supplied \\nto energy consumers. In addition, the most cost-effective way of using \\nenergy from generators or accumulated in storage is also systematically \\nidentified from the optimization models. Two optimization models are \\nproposed for the identification of optimal supply for heat and electricity. \\nThese models can be combined to consider heat and electricity man-\\nagement simultaneously when energy is produced through a combined \\nheat and power (CHP) unit. The model proposed in this work is \\nformulated in a multi-period manner, which enables the systematic \\nconsideration of different profiles of energy demand and renewable \\ngeneration for daily change and seasonal variation. \\nThe mathematical expression for describing the generation, utiliza -\\ntion, and storage of heat and electricity is kept as simple as possible, \\nmaking it easier to implement its optimization models and computation. \\nFig. 1.Heat and electricity supply to energy consumers.

Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 183 (2023) 113429\\n4The amounts of heat or electricity to be generated, exchanged, or \\naccumulated are key decision variables and are characterized on an \\nhour-by-hour basis under a given seasonal period. Detailed transport \\nphenomena, for example, heat transfer and fluid hydraulics, are not \\nconsidered in this work because these considerations significantly in-\\ncrease modeling complexities owing to the non-linearity they introduce. \\nSimplicity in the optimization model is maintained by considering key \\nenergy flows of streams involved in energy supply and exchange rather \\nthan the mass flow of working fluids together with the consideration of \\nthe thermodynamic and physical properties of streams. Additionally, the \\nsteady-state modeling of energy exchanges is maintained as dynamic \\nsimulation requires a considerable computation load for solving \\nnumerous differential equations. \\n2.1. Model equations and constraints \\nSets, parameters, and variables employed in the optimization models \\nare provided in the Appendix. The following assumptions are made for \\nformulating the optimization models in this study:  \\n≡Energy demand, use, and storage are expressed in an hour-by-hour \\nbasis with a representative value for each period.  \\n≡Steady-state energy exchange is assumed for each period.  \\n≡Energy loss related to the heat storage and transportation of heat \\nbetween sources and sinks is simplified with an overall energy loss \\nparameter.  \\n≡Hydraulic effects are assumed to be negligible. \\nThe first optimization model described in this section determines the \\nmost cost-effective heat supply to consumers and its storage when \\nrenewable energy is integrated to the supply. The objective function in \\nEq. (1) minimizes the overall cost associated with the generation of heat \\nand its import from a district heating system, generation from a \\nrenewable-based unit, and storage, as given in Eqs. (2)–(5). Energy \\nbalance for heat flows between a boiler, renewable-based heater, and \\nthermal energy storage is given in Eq. (6), while the profiles of accu-\\nmulated heat in the thermal storage are calculated with Eqs. (7) and (8). \\nHeat is lost during storage and transportation between sources and \\nsinks; in this study, the heat loss is simplified with a single lumped value \\nfor an overall energy loss parameter of (HELTES) in Eqs. (7) and (8). The \\nmore detailed formulations in Eqs. (6)–(8) may be considered by \\nintroducing individual energy loss parameters between a source and \\nsink and/or considering hourly energy loss based on the storage volume \\nand its geometry. However, such a detailed mathematical description is \\nnot employed in this work to simplify the overall model. \\nNo negative accumulated heat flow is constrained with Eq. (9), \\nwhich can be further elaborated to enforce the minimum level of heat \\nstored in the storage facility if necessary. The contribution of renewable- \\nbased heat to the overall heating demand can be specified in Eq. (10), \\nalthough this equation would not be required if no constraint was \\nimposed on the level of renewable heat that must be used. The hour-by- \\nhour generation profiles of renewable-based heat follows the typical \\ndaily pattern of renewable energy generation, for which capacity is \\naccordingly adjusted to balance heat flows in Eq.

Solution strategy for optimization \\nOne of the main strategies in model building is to minimize the use of \\nnon-linear equations. For example, the evaluation of capital and oper-\\nating costs is expressed with linear cost functions. The only non-linear \\nelements in the model are the equation related to the identification of \\nmaximum heat or electricity generation and the bilinear terms in Eq. \\n(26). These discontinuous or bilinear terms can be linearized to equiv -\\nalent mathematical expressions in which a set of new binary and \\ncontinuous variables are introduced with the implementation of addi-\\ntional constraints. However, such linearization is not employed to \\nmaintain the simplicity of the optimization model and a modest number \\nof variables. These discrete or bilinear features in the optimization can \\nbe effectively handled by applying stochastic optimization solvers, \\nalthough global optimality may not be guaranteed. \\nIn this work, the case study presented in the next section is conducted \\nwith an Excel ® Add-in Solver. The size of the formulated optimization \\nproblem is modest enough to be effectively computed with Excel ® \\nSolver. The Solver also offers an evolutionary method that can be used \\nfor problems having non-smooth functions. If the number of decision \\nvariables to be optimized were considerably large, specialized optimi -\\nzation packages, for example, GAMS ®, LINDO ® or Optimization \\nToolbox of MATLAB ®, would be required. \\nThe optimization problem is not fully linear, and the optimized so-\\nlution depends on the choice of starting points. The initial choice of \\nstarting points for the optimization is made as the average hourly rate \\nrequired for meeting daily energy demand for the energy to be gener -\\nated. Multiple runs were performed with different starting points, for \\nexample, solutions from previous runs or other similar scenarios. The \\nexecution of an GRG method in the Excel ® Solver can provide the \\noptimal solution, although maximum selection functions are featured in \\nthe model. Hence, the solution identified with the GRG method is also \\nused as additional initial points for optimization. \\nOne additional step is required before executing the solver for the \\noptimization presented in this work. When the optimization is built in a spreadsheet environment, indirect circular referencing occurs for the \\nimplementation of energy accumulated in the heat storage of Eqs. (7) \\nand (8) and electricity storage of Eqs. (18) and (19). When the system is \\nfully optimized, the level of energy storage should be zero for at least a \\nsingle hour-long period in 24 h, unless the minimum storage level is \\napplied in Eq. (9) or 20. To avoid such circular referencing, an analytic \\nprocedure is used when the model is initialized with starting points for \\nthe optimization. A sufficiently large value is selected for stored energy \\nat the 1st-hour time point, rather than the available energy at the 24th- \\nhour time point, with which the accumulated level of energy storage is \\ncalculated from the 1st to 24th-hour time point. The accumulated en-\\nergy levels are then examined, and the most bottlenecked time points, \\nthat is, the minimum level of energy accumulation, are identified. At the \\nbottlenecked time point, the surplus energy available at the previous \\ntime point is not added to that at the current time point, and the accu-\\nmulation from the 24th to 1st-hour point is now allowed. Computational \\ndifficulties related to such iterative referencing can be dealt with \\nthrough this manual break and adjustment around the bottlenecked time \\npoint for the energy storage. The overall strategy for solving the opti-\\nmization problem proposed in this work is schematically illustrated in \\nFig. 2. \\n3.Case study \\nTwo cases are taken for the applicability of the proposed optimiza -\\ntion framework as given in Table 1. Energy demand data given on an \\nhourly basis are extracted from reference [25]. A set of cases considered \\nin this work is selected to represent two widely occurring characteristics \\nfor the analysis of the energy management of commercial buildings. The \\ndata of case study 1 are based on the heat and power demand of a \\nnursing home. These profiles show a typical energy consumption pattern \\nthat occurs in the residential sector; it has peaks in the morning and \\nevening without sudden changes in demand. In contrast, for case study \\n2, the data are based on the power consumption of a school. This shows a \\npower usage pattern commonly observed in the commercial sector; there \\nis very low power demand outside office hours, and a very sharp in-\\ncrease in power supply is required at the beginning of the working day. \\nRenewable energy sources are often available in an intermittent and \\nfluctuating manner. In addition, intensity and behavior of their energy \\ngeneration is highly location specific. For the conceptual design of en-\\nergy systems with renewable energy, typical profiles of renewable en-\\nergy generation are selected, which are then imposed throughout the \\nday during model optimization. The amount of energy generated from \\nrenewable sources is scaled up during the optimization through the \\nmultiplication of the capacity factor, as shown in Eqs. (11) and (22) for \\nheat and electricity, respectively. In this study, two types of renewable \\nsources are considered, namely, solar and wind energy, whose typical \\nprofiles are referenced from the IEA [26] and NREL [27], respectively. \\nA few assumptions were made for the case studies. The maximum \\ncapacity of the energy generator was taken as the maximum energy \\ndemand, while the minimum capacity of the energy generator was one \\nthird of the maximum capacity. The hourly energy loss for energy \\nstorage and its related exchange of heat was assumed to be 5% of the \\ntotal energy accumulated in the storage unit and no energy loss related \\nto the circulation of working fluids and its heat exchange was assumed. \\nIt should be noted that more detailed energy loss can be considered at \\nthe expense of model complexity. For example, heat losses of a heat \\nstorage unit can be modeled with the full consideration of storage vol-\\numes and charging levels of a working fluid [19]. The import cost of \\ndistrict heat was 0.086 US$/kWh [28] and the purchasing price of \\nexternal electricity was assumed to be 0.1 US$/kWh. Costing data used \\nfor the evaluation of capital expenditure and operating costs are given in \\nTable 2. An underlying assumption for the use of this costing informa -\\ntion is that the degradation of energy efficiency in part-load operation is \\nnot considered. \\nThe cost evaluation based on Table 2 is performed at the conceptual J.-K.

More rigorous economic costing can be modeled for the \\noptimization. For example, operating costs can be further broken down to consider fuel and other maintenance costs. Fuel costs in energy gen-\\neration can be elaborated by introducing the efficiency of energy gen-\\neration and the evaluation of part-load performance.

This is because there are \\ndistinct differences between unit costs of the energy supply options \\nconsidered in this study. The cost of importing electricity or heat is \\nhigher than that of energy generated on-site, and the cost of energy \\ngenerated from renewable sources is much larger than that of conven -\\ntional fossil fuel-based generators. Unless constraints to limit the supply \\nfrom boilers or power generators are imposed, the use of renewable \\nenergy or import of external energy is not selected from the \\noptimization. \\n3.1. Case study 1 \\nThe first case study illustrates how the proposed design and opti-\\nmization method can be effectively applied to the heat and electricity \\nmanagement of a nursing home subject to renewable energy integration. \\nOptimization Models 1 and 2 are first applied for a single-period prob-\\nlem for heat and electricity management, which is then followed by the \\nsimultaneous management of heat and electricity with the aid of Model \\n3. This case study is further elaborated to demonstrate the capability of \\nthe proposed optimization model for a multi-period problem in heat \\nmanagement, as well as for different renewable generation patterns. \\n3.1.1. Heat management with solar energy integration \\nThe scenario considered in this subsection is to determine the most \\neffective heat supply to the consumer during a typical winter day when \\nsolar energy is integrated to energy supply. The optimization is per-\\nformed with four different levels from 5% to 20% as the contribution of \\nsolar energy to the overall heat demand. Without imposing the contri -\\nbution level of solar energy, the use of solar energy is not featured in the \\noptimized solution because the relative utilization cost of solar heat is \\nmuch higher than the cost of heat generation from a conventional boiler. \\nThe results of optimization are given in Fig. 3, in which hour-by-hour \\nvariations in heat supplied from the boiler and solar energy are shown \\nwith the heat accumulated in the storage unit. \\nOptimization is carried out with the variable working load of a boiler \\nand the results are given in Fig. 3 (a)–(d). The heat generation is varied \\nbetween the maximum and minimum capacity, with which the profile of \\nheat demand is effectively followed. As shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), the \\nstorage of heat is not required when the contribution of solar-based heat \\ngeneration is relatively low. This situation is because the heat generation \\nfrom a boiler is flexible enough to balance the amount of solar heat \\navailable. \\nSolar heat generation is maximized in the middle of the day and is \\nzero from evening to morning. Hence, heat storage is required when the \\nsupply of solar heat is increased as shown in Fig. 3 (c) and (d). There is a \\nflat part in the profiles of heat generation from a boiler in Fig. 3 (c) and \\n(d) because of the boiler’s lowest capacity constraint. Solar heat through \\nstorage is effectively utilized during the day because of the nature of \\nsolar heat generation. Accordingly, the heat production from a boiler during the day is reduced but production in the morning and evening \\nfollows the profile of heat demand, as shown in Fig. 3 (a)–(d). \\nFig. 3 (e) and (f) shows the results of optimization with the appli -\\ncation of the fixed capacity for heat generation in a boiler throughout \\nthe day. This scenario illustrates that the heat storage facility plays an \\nimportant role in the storage of available heat when heat generation or \\nimport cannot be varied. The overall daily demand is 15,690 kWh and \\nthe fixed capacity for heat generation from a boiler should be 653.75 kW \\nwhen no heat loss is assumed. \\nThe fixed heat generation capacity of Fig. 3 (e) and (f) is identified \\nwith 655.2 kW and 575.8 kW, respectively, under 5% and 20% of solar \\nheat contribution. Although solar energy is utilized, the fixed heat \\ngeneration capacity for the boiler integrated with 5% solar heating is \\ngreater than 653.57 kW owing to the heat loss rate considered during \\nheat storage. The maximum storage capacity is significantly increased to \\n2542.2 kWh for 20% solar heat contribution in Fig. 3 (f), which is 366% \\nhigher than that for a flexible boiler working load, whose maximum \\nstorage capacity is 694.4 kWh, as given in Fig. 3 (d). \\nThe unit cost of heat generated from a boiler is the cheapest, while \\nthat of heat imported from district heat is the most expensive under the \\ncosting parameters used in the case study. The optimized annual cost of \\nheat supply increases with a greater solar heat contribution. Further, \\nheat import from a district heating system has not occurred for this case, \\nas on-site heat generation and its utilization through a heat storage is \\nmore economic than heat import. The optimization model developed in \\nthis study can be considered for the import of heat from external sources \\nby specifying the variables of heat import. \\n3.1.2. Electricity management with solar energy integration \\nThe optimization with Model 2 is applied for the design and sizing of \\nan electricity generator and an electricity storage unit, subject to solar \\nenergy integration. A typical profile for the 24 h of electricity demand \\nfor a nursing home during the winter season is considered. The contri -\\nbution level of solar electricity generation varies from 10% to 35%, as \\nshown in Fig. 4. As the cost for using solar electricity is not lower than \\nthat of conventionally generated electricity, an approach similar to that \\nused in the previous section is employed to enforce certain levels of solar \\nelectricity contribution to the overall demand. \\nThe characteristics of the heat supply and storage profiles observed \\nfrom Fig. 3 are also shown in Fig. 4. The middle part of the profile is flat \\nfor electricity generation in Fig. 4 (d), (e), and (f), which is related to the \\nminimum capacity of electricity generation imposed in the optimization \\nmodel. Electricity generation from a generator follows the demand \\nprofile in the morning and evening as the availability of solar energy \\ngradually increases and decreases after the peak during the day. \\nFor the heat management problem in Fig. 3, the heat demand be-\\ntween the peaks at 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. has a convex profile, while a \\nconcave profile of energy demand is observed during the day, as shown \\nin Fig. 4. Because of this difference, electricity storage becomes neces -\\nsary and plays an important role in electricity management at relatively \\nhigher contribution levels of solar energy compared to previous heat \\nmanagement problems. For example, although the solar electricity Table 2 \\nEconomic costing data.  \\nUnits CAPEX \\n[US$/kW] OPEX (fixed) [US$/kW/yr] OPEX (variable) [US$/MWh] OPEX (maintenance) [US$/kWh] Reference \\nSteam generator a 0.18 9.5 17.0 – [29] c \\nElectricity generator b 0.9 4.5 56  \\nSolar (thermal) 500 – – 0.5 [19] \\nSolar (electricity) 3237 – – 0.25 \\nStorage (thermal) 100 – – 0 \\nStorage (electricity) 193 – – 0  \\naA boiler is taken for a steam generator. \\nbA combined cycle gas turbine is taken for an electricity generator. \\nc1 Euro is assumed to be 1 USD.

Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 183 (2023) 113429\\n103.1.3. CHP management with solar energy integration \\nThis case demonstrates how the simultaneous design of heat and \\nelectricity supply can be systematically carried out with optimization \\nModel 3. CHP systems have been widely used in residential and com-\\nmercial sectors because high cogeneration efficiency can be achieved \\nwhen heat and power are produced simultaneously. Different types of \\nCHP technologies, such as reciprocating engine, gas turbine, steam \\nturbine and fuel cell, are available. Depending on the operational \\ncharacteristics of producing heat and power, each CHP technology has a \\ntypical working range for certain heat to power production ratios [30]. \\nCHP systems based on a boiler-integrated steam turbine are suitable \\nwhen a relatively large amount of heat is required. When a modest \\namount of steam is required, systems based on a reciprocating engine or \\na gas turbine are better for the cost effective generation of heat and \\npower. Typical working ranges of heat-to-power ratios for CHP tech-\\nnologies have been 0.83 –1.67 for reciprocating engines, 1–1.66 for gas \\nturbines, and 10–14.29 for steam turbines [31]. \\nThe relative interdependence between heat and power generation \\nshould be then considered for the operational optimization of energy \\nsupply through CHP systems, as a relative heat-to-power ratio is very \\ntechnology-specific. The focus of this study is to provide the optimal \\nprofiles of heat and electricity supply from conventional energy gener -\\nators as well as renewable energy sources; hence, it investigates the \\nimpact of the co-generation of heat and power on the management of \\nenergy generation and storage and does not determine the optimal heat- \\nto-power ratio in relation to the choice of CHP technologies. \\nIn this example, simultaneous optimization is performed for the heat \\nand electricity demands considered in the previous two cases based on \\nenergy demand of the same consumer. Fig. 5 (a) shows the optimized \\nenergy profiles of heat and electricity with a solar contribution of 10%, \\nwhich was independently optimized without simultaneously consid -\\nering the relationship of heat and electricity generation. When the \\nprofiles of heat generation from a boiler is compared with that of elec-\\ntricity generation, these hour-by-hour patterns are different, which \\nwould be technically challenging under a CHP operating mode. \\nThe optimization is now conducted with Model 3 and its results are \\nshown in Fig. 5 (b)–(d), where the generation profile of heat from a CHP \\nunit exactly follows that of power using Eq. (26). For comparison pur-\\nposes, the optimization was performed with a solar power contribution \\nof 10%, solar power and heat contributions of 5%, and solar heat \\ncontribution of 10%, and the results are given in Fig. 5 (b), (c), and (d), \\nrespectively. As a particular contribution level of renewable energy is \\nimposed, the heat-to-power ratios given in Fig. 5 are determined during \\noptimization. When the specific heat-to-power ratio should be consid -\\nered, the constant value of RiCHP in Eq. (26) is used. \\nWhen Fig. 5 (a) is compared with Fig. 5 (b), (c), and (d), the role of an \\nenergy storage unit becomes important to supply heat and power with a \\nsingle CHP unit; this is because the CHP unit is inflexible compared to \\nseparate production. Further, different heat-to-power ratios are ob-\\ntained, which implies the importance of selecting the appropriate CHP \\ntechnology. For the example a 10% contribution from renewable energy, \\na CHP system with either a gas turbine or reciprocating engine is to be \\nimplemented. Because the typical working range of the heat-to-power \\nratio is 0.63 –0.77 [31], a fuel cell system is not appropriate for this \\nexample. \\n3.1.4. Multi-period heat management with solar energy integration \\nThe next scenario for Case Study 1 is the application of optimization \\nmodels for multi-period problems in which seasonal differences in en-\\nergy demand are considered. In this subsection, the heat demand of a \\nconsumer for winter and summer are simultaneously considered and no \\nconstraints are imposed on the heat generated from a boiler for both \\nseasons if the heat generation is between the maximum and minimum \\ncapacities. When renewable solar energy is integrated, seasonal varia -\\ntion in energy generation should be considered. The variability of the \\nannual generation of solar energy is considered as the implementation of the relative ratio of solar energy between a maximum and minimum of \\n109% and 91%, respectively [32], with which a solar energy generation \\nprofile in the winter season is proportionally adjusted with that of \\nsummer. \\nSolar heat contributions of 5%, 10%, and 15% are considered for \\nsummer, and the solar heat generation profiles of winter are changed \\naccordingly to realize the ratio of 1.1978 (\\x88109%/91%) between \\nsummer and winter, assuming that the location for the study is in the \\nnorthern hemisphere. The results of optimizations for winter and sum-\\nmer are given in Fig. 6. \\n3.1.5. Heat and electricity management with wind energy integration \\nThe final scenario considered in this section is to accommodate \\ndifferent energy generation patterns of renewable sources. The optimi -\\nzation in the previous sections is based on solar energy whose profile is \\nrelatively continuous and monotonous. In contrast, energy generation \\nfrom wind is not constant and randomly varies. The typical pattern of \\nwind energy generation considered in this study is taken from the \\nreference given in Table 1; its capacity is adjusted during the optimi -\\nzation to match the required wind energy contribution, as in previous \\ncases. The contribution levels of 20%, 30%, and 40% were considered \\nfor the heat and electricity management of a nursing home in winter. \\nFig. 7 (a) to (c) show the optimization results when wind-based heat \\nis supplied to the consumer, where the heat generation from a boiler \\nfollows the heat demand profiles and the heat supply between a boiler \\nand a solar-based heat generator is balanced through a heat storage unit. \\nSimilar matching characteristics for electricity supply are observed for \\nelectricity management, as shown in Fig. 7 (d)–(e). However, contrary to \\nFig. 7 (c), balancing energy storage units becomes important at night for \\nelectricity management, as shown in Fig. 7 (e). This difference is related \\nto high electricity demand during the day compared to high heat de-\\nmand in the morning or early evening. This example demonstrates the \\nbenefit of using optimization methods for the design and sizing of energy \\nsupply systems that include renewable energy, which should be suffi-\\nciently flexible to consider different time-dependent and region-specific \\npatterns of availability for renewable energy. \\n3.2. Case study 2 \\nThe second case study applies the developed optimization models for \\ndifferent profiles of energy demand. The energy consumer considered in \\nthis case is a school, and heat management for winter is studied as given \\nin Table 1. Solar energy is assumed to be available to supply heat along \\nwith a conventional boiler. Owing to the behavior of individuals in the \\nschool, heat demand rapidly peaks at 8 a.m. and gradually decreases \\nthereafter, while virtually no heat is required in the evening and at \\nnight. Compared to profiles of energy demand considered in case study \\n1, case study 2 has a large difference between the maximum and mini-\\nmum heat demand, and the change in heat demand is substantial over a \\nshort period. \\nThe first scenario in this subsection is to impose no limitation on the \\ncapacity of a boiler. This is too idealized because the maximum and \\nminimum demand are 1105 and 20 kWh, respectively. The minimum \\nload is only 1.8% of the maximum one and such part-load operation in \\nenergy generation is not favored owing to practical or economic reasons. \\nFive levels of solar heat contribution from 0% to 20% are considered for \\nthe optimization, as shown in Fig. 8. \\nFrom the optimization, the maximum capacity of heat generation is \\n590 kW for a solar heat contribution of 0%, which is well below the \\nmaximum demand of 1105 kWh. This considerable reduction in the \\nboiler capacity is due to the use of a heat storage unit. However, when \\nthe contribution of solar heat increases, the maximum capacity of a \\nboiler only slightly decreases to 546 kW. This is because heat demand at \\nthe peak is high, although the heat generated from a boiler after \\nlunchtime is supplemented with solar-based heat. Because no minimum \\nload is considered in this case, the boiler operates at a low rate for most J.-K.

The second scenario \\nfor this case study is to consider different maximum capacities between \\n100 and 600 kW when the contribution of solar heat is fixed at the same \\nlevel of 10%. The minimum capacity is assumed to be one-third of the \\nmaximum capacity. \\nFig. 9 shows optimization results when the boiler generation ca-\\npacity is varied between its maximum and minimum capacities. Fig. 9 \\n(h), which can be compared with Fig. 9 (a)–(g), is added. Because of the \\nlimitations of the maximum heat generation, a bigger heat storage unit is \\nrequired and a greater contribution is required from the stored heat \\ncompared to the cases of no limitations on the boiler capacity. Fig. 9 (a)– \\n(g) shows that for a higher minimum capacity of heat generation, a \\ngreater contribution is required from the storage unit and the unit must \\nbe larger. In the first case study, the heat import is featured in the \\noptimized results in Fig. 9 (a)–(d) when a small heat generator is \\nemployed. For the example in Fig. 9, the contribution of solar heat to the \\noverall heat demand is set to 10%, which is insufficient to compensate \\nfor insufficient amounts of heat from the boiler. The second case study \\nalso illustrates the applicability and usefulness of the proposed optimi -\\nzation method to different types of energy generation patterns when \\nthere are capacity constraints. \\n4.Conclusions and future work \\nThis study proposes an optimization framework that is applicable for \\nthe determination of the cost-effective operating profiles of energy \\ngeneration and energy storage when renewable energy is integrated to \\nenergy supply. The formulated optimization model is based on energy \\nbalances related to energy generation, storage, and exchange, which \\nmaintains the simplicity of the optimization model. This simplicity al-\\nlows the execution of the optimization with a spreadsheet-based solver. \\nA multi-period representation of energy flows to be exchanged with \\nconsumers is taken for steady-state optimization, with which the cost- \\neffective hour-by-hour variations for energy supply, renewable energy, \\nenergy storage, and external import are systematically determined. The \\noptimization model developed in this study also allows for the identi -\\nfication of the optimal size of energy generation and storage units ac-\\ncording to the degree of renewable energy use and generation capacity \\nconstraints. \\nCase studies were used to integrate renewable energy to conven -\\ntional fossil fuel-based energy systems with solar and wind energy \\ncontributions from 0% to 40% and 0%–20%, respectively. Scenarios of \\nenergy management for summer and winter were considered in the case \\nstudies, where heat management, electricity management, and combined heat-and-electricity management were investigated. These \\ncase studies clearly demonstrate the applicability of the proposed opti-\\nmization models. \\nMoreover, the case studies illustrate the importance of using the \\nproposed optimization models. The size and contribution of an energy \\nstorage unit required to compensate for surpluses or deficits between \\nenergy demand and supply are effectively identified with the aid of the \\nproposed optimization method, and the relative contribution of \\nrenewable sources and conventional energy-generation is cost- \\neffectively determined. \\nAlthough the model presented in this work is computationally \\neffective and robust, a few issues must be investigated further. The en-\\nergy efficiency of energy generation units during part-load is typically \\nreduced compared to that of full-load, and the consideration of perfor -\\nmance deterioration during part-load in the optimization model can \\nimprove the economic trade-off between renewable and conventional \\nenergy. Renewable energy sources other than solar and wind should be \\nconsidered in future case studies; this consideration will improve the \\nunderstanding of the impact of the availability characteristics of \\nrenewable sources. \\nCredit author statement \\nJin-Kuk Kim: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Soft-\\nware, Writing Original draft preparation.

Financial entities such as large \\nbanks and institutional investors are active in providing syndicated loans for infrastructure projects and compete \\nto offer better terms to the sponsors of these projects. The literature is full of research on capital structure \\noptimization. We propose a novel stochastic framework for optimizing the debt service schedule with due regard \\nto the probability of default of the project company. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated \\nfor a 10 MW solar photovoltaic project employing a genetic algorithm (GA) as the optimization tool. The NASA \\nSSE dataset is used to collect irradiation data, and PVsyst software is employed to simulate the performance of \\nthe project. The uncertainties are accounted for using Monte Carlo simulation, and the revenue generated, its \\ncorresponding free cash flow and the debt service coverage ratio are simulated as random variables. The pro-\\nposed optimization framework enables lenders to offer an optimized debt service that maximizes the share -\\nholder ’s profitability index. A particle swarm optimization is also employed to validate the stability and \\nusefulness of GA optimization.   \\n1.Introduction \\nThe demand for energy continues to grow worldwide. Given that \\npower generation is the primary source of global warming and green -\\nhouse gas emissions (Field et al., 2014 ; Agency et al. Agency; \\nMitchellet al.), governments of many countries are attempting to curtail \\nemissions and keep climate change within safe limits. This goal is \\naccepted to be well below 2 •C, as stated by the Paris Agreement, as well \\nas a shift towards low-carbon technologies (Field et al., 2014 ; “Climate \\nFinance in, 2013; Polzin, 2017 ). In the endeavor to decarbonize power \\ngeneration and supersede fossil fuel resources, non-dispatchable inter-\\nmittent renewable energy and non-depletable energy sources are the \\nbest choices (Williamset al., 2012 ), among which solar photovoltaics \\nand wind are of great importance (Chu and Majumdar, 2012 ). \\nBecause renewable energy is capital intensive (Habib and Johnsen, \\n1999 ; Schmidt, 2014 ), policymakers have justifiable concerns regarding \\nthe financing of these capital-intensive projects. Renewable energy \\nprojects across Europe received over €100 billion of syndicated loans \\nbetween 2013 and 2019 (Moody ’s Investor Service, 2019 ). Moreover, \\nthe European Union has predicted increased demand for investment of \\nroughly €180 billion each year in order to reach its climate change targets (European Commission and “Com, 2018). \\nThe significance of capital provision for renewable fuel systems is \\nwell-understood, but little research has been done on the various aspects \\nof project finance in the renewable energy industry (Hall et al., 2017 ). \\nHowever, recently, Steffen (2018) has highlighted the importance of \\nproject finance for renewable energy projects. \\nAlthough the technology risk in most renewable energy projects is \\nlow (Mazzucato and Semieniuk, 2018 ), developers could face imminent \\ncounterparty risks due to the innate nature of each project and the un-\\ncertainties created by the somewhat longer maturities in this industry. \\nThe primary risks that might affect renewable energy projects are \\nfinancial, political, and cultural, as outlined by Komendantova et al. \\n(2020) and Donovan (Charles, 2015 ). These unavoidable construction \\nand operation risks cause lenders to appraise the inherent credit risk at \\nthe outset of investment over the entire life of the financing (Gatti et al., \\n2007 ). \\nGenerally, credit risk is rooted in the failure of shareholders to \\nreimburse the debt service at a specific time (Zhang and Li, 2018 ). \\nBecause the determination of credit risk in project finance is complex \\nand a lender should not rely on the creditworthiness of shareholders, in \\nthis study, the bounded probability of default of the project is used as a \\n*Corresponding author. \\nE-mail addresses: firouzi@srbiau.ac.ir (A.

Gatti (Gatti et al., 2007 ) found \\nthat default will occur when the project ’s free cash flow falls below its \\ndebt service obligations, and the debt cannot be repaid within the spe-\\ncific time period. The first step to default analysis is to model the net \\ncash flow over the project lifecycle. \\nMoody ’s has reported that institutional investors, such as insurance \\ncompanies and pension funds that excel at providing financing for the \\nrenewable energy industry, are competing with the banks to syndicate \\nloans (Moody ’s Investor Service, 2019 ). Given that signing a long-term \\npartnership contract with project creators provides a competitive busi-\\nness advantage for banks (Ganbat et al., 2016 ), banks and other financial \\ninstitutions are interested in attracting project finance deals. \\nSponsors generally desire to have the debt repaid in the initial years \\nof operation in order to receive more of the invested portion for reuse in \\nnew investments to increase their return (Charles, 2015 ). Thus, an \\noptimal arrangement of debt servicing within the maturity period will \\nincrease the profitability of the sponsors. Hence, the presence of an \\nefficient optimization tool that can comfortably satisfy the lender ’s \\ncredit concern while tailoring or sculpting the debt service for share -\\nholders is of vital importance. \\nProject finance has been utilized in capital intensive infrastructure \\nprojects worldwide over the past five decades (“Project Finance Recent \\nA, 2015). Much research in the past 30 years has been carried out on the \\noptimization of project debt sizing, but most have relied mainly on \\ndetermining the optimal capital structure which maximizes the profit -\\nability of shareholders (Dias and Ioannou, 1995 ; Stephen et al., 2001 ; \\nBakatjan et al., 2003 ). Zhang (Xueqing, 2005 ) developed an optimiza -\\ntion model to determine the optimal capital structure and assess a pro-\\nject’s financial viability as it is exposed to economic, construction, and \\nbankruptcy risks. These projects will be subject to imposed constraints, \\nsuch as the minimum equity level, minimum debt service coverage ratio \\n(DSCR) and minimum ratio of debt to equity. \\nYun (Yun et al., 2009 ) generated a model that establishes a range of \\nequity ratios for selecting the best financial leverage for a specific \\nproject and considered the internal rate of return and DSCR simulta -\\nneously. Iyer and Sagheer (2012) developed a model that increased \\nbid-winning probability in addition to profitability in a public-private \\npartnership project. Feng (Feng et al., 2017 ) proposed an optimization \\nmodel in which the public, private equity, and all government subsidies \\nare optimized concurrently for public-private partnership projects. \\nThe probability of project finance default and credit rating are \\ninterrelated (Kong et al., 2008 ). Project ratings provided by rating \\nagencies are intended to express the level of certainty with which project \\nlenders can expect to receive punctual reimbursement of the debt service \\nin accordance with the project term sheets. The analytical approach used \\nby a rating agency (“Standard & poor ’s projec, 2014) usually addresses \\nbusiness and legal institutional development; project-level risks; force \\nmajeure risks; credit enhancements and sovereign risks (Thompson, \\n2012 ). These ratings are being utilized by the sponsors, financial in-\\nstitutions and lenders in the negotiation over the duration and loan in-\\nterest rate spread for the project finance structures. \\nTo the best of our knowledge, the literature regarding project finance \\nhas chiefly focused on financial leverage optimization. There appears to \\nbe a paucity of research regarding debt service schedule optimization, \\nmost notably those that consider sponsor lifecycle probability of default \\nas a constraint. Our study proposes a novel and practical optimization \\ntool for banks and financial institutions that enables them to offer an \\nenticing and more attractive debt repayment schedule to the project \\nsponsors, whose profitability will be enhanced in a competitive market. \\nCreditors are seeking to win the bid when there is a high liquidity market \\ncondition. \\nOur model takes the next step forward to find the optimum debt \\nservice schedule for any financial leverage ratio. We also assume that the \\nprevailing market sentiment is bullish, and competing creditors in a high \\nliquidity market are open to offering a debt service schedule optimizing the value for SPV sponsors. \\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a cursory \\nbackground of the concepts of project finance, assessment of the prob-\\nability of default and credit risk, and solar energy projects. Section 3 \\npresents the methodology of the current approach. A worked example is \\nproposed in section 4 using the methodology presented in section 3 to \\nillustrate its applicability in solar projects. Section 5 compares and dis-\\ncusses the results. Section 6 presents the conclusions. \\n2.Background \\nThe literature review in this study embodies three sections. Section \\n2.1 presents the definition and underlying principles of project finance \\nand reviews several widely-used financial indicators. Section 2.2 re-\\nviews credit risk and the probability of default and reviews calculations \\nin the world of finance. The probability of default is introduced as a key \\nindicator used to determine a sponsor ’s probability of default from the \\nperspective of creditors. Section 2.3 reviews the procedure for esti-\\nmating energy yield for a solar PV power plant representative of \\nrenewable energy projects. \\n2.1. Project finance \\nProject finance could be defined as structured financing of a stand- \\nalone project company, also referred to as the special purpose vehicle \\n(SPV). The SPV is created by developers and can raise two primary \\ndiscrete categories of funding: the equity of shareholders and the debt \\nprovided by the lender. The cash flow generated during the operation \\nperiod is considered the primary source of reimbursing the loan (Gatti, \\n2013 ; Firouzi and Vahdatmanesh, 2019 ). It should be controlled to \\nprovide lenders with early warning about requesting premature repay -\\nment of the SPV during operation years (Borgonovo and Gatti, 2013 ). \\nThis procedure could sharply increase the developer ’s financial leverage \\nand strengthen business while respecting lender concerns (International \\nFinance Cor, 1999 ). \\nKey financial indicators are broadly used in project finance to control \\nthe viability and profitability of a proposed financial transaction. These \\nindicators are generally constructed using the discounted cash flow \\ntechnique (Feng et al., 2017 ; Ho, 2002 ; Kim et al., 2013 ) and commonly \\ninclude profitability indices such as the net present value, profitability \\nindex (PI), and viability indices that include DSCR and loan life coverage \\nratio. These indicators have been identified in academic works on \\nproject finance and the renewable energy sector (Xueqing, 2005 ; Gatti, \\n2018a ; Ye et al., 2017 ). \\nThe DSCR is classically used when financing private asset-heavy \\ninfrastructure projects (nfrastructure Inst, 2016 ) and is the ratio of the \\nyearly free cash flow (FCF) of the project to its corresponding interest \\nand principal repayments (Borgonovo and Gatti, 2013 ; Pacudan, \\n2016a ). This index is an acceptable threshold for a creditor by which the \\nloan can be repaid using the available cash flow (Bakatjan et al., 2003 ) \\nas: \\nDSCR t\\x88FCF t\\nIt\\x87Ptt\\x881C2C…CTL(1)  \\nwhere It and Pt are the interest and principal repayment for period t, TL \\nis the loan repayment period and FCF t is the FCF at time t and is defined \\nas (Borgonovo and Gatti, 2013 ): \\nFCFt\\x88\\x851\\x00τ\\x86\\x85Rt\\x00OE t\\x86\\x87τ×\\x89δ×\\x85A0\\x87Idc\\x86\\x87X×It\\x8a\\nt\\u200b\\x881C\\u200b2C…CTL (2)  \\nwhere τ is the income tax rate, δ is the depreciation rate of the asset with \\na linear depreciation assumption and no salvage value, Rt is the revenue \\nat time t, OEt is the operating expenses at time t, A0 is the investment \\ncost, Idc is the accumulated interest in the construction years (Borgonovo \\nand Gatti, 2013 ), and X is the indicator function, where X \\x881 when t < A. Firouzi and A. Meshkani                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Utilities Policy 70 (2021) 101197\\n3TL and X \\x880 when t FTL. \\nThe FCF of equity-holders can be calculated as follows (Borgonovo \\nand Gatti, 2013 ): \\nFCFE t\\x88\\x851\\x00τ\\x86\\x85Rt\\x00OE t\\x86\\x87τ×\\x89δ×\\x85A0\\x87Idc\\x86\\x87X×It\\x8a\\x00X×\\x85It\\x87Pt\\x86\\n(3) \\nIt should be noted that X is introduced to model the time remaining \\nfrom the loan maturity to the end of the operational life of the con-\\nstructed assets. This so-called “tail” time enables the creditor to mitigate \\nthe risk linked to the fact that obstacles may come up during the loan ’s \\ntenor, which could preclude the chance to refinance the outstanding \\ndebt within the remaining time to loan maturity. Hence, if the project \\ncannot repay the debt during TL, there is extra time that gives the \\ncreditor the chance to get their remaining debt services before the end of \\nthe asset ’s operational life. \\nThe equity-holder net present value (NPVE) and creditor net present \\nvalue (NPVC) can be calculated as follows (Gatti, 2013 ; Borgonovo and \\nGatti, 2013 ; Han et al., 2016 ; Haoet al., 2018 ): \\nNPVE\\u200b\\x88\\x00\\x851\\x00\\u200bF\\x86A0\\x87̂T\\nt\\x881FCF Et\\n\\x851\\x87CoE\\x86\\nt\\x881C\\u200b2C…CTo(4)  \\nNPVC\\x88̂T\\nt\\x881It\\x87Pt\\n\\x851\\x87CoD\\x86\\nt\\x881C2C…CTL(5)  \\nwhere F is the financial leverage ratio To is the operation period, and CoE \\nand CoD are the cost of equity and debt, respectively. \\nRoss (1995) argued that the NPV does not depict the amount of profit \\nin line with the invested share. Therefore, in this study, the PI of the \\nequity holders is used and can be calculated as a complement after the \\ndetermination of shareholder NPV as follows: \\nPI\\x881\\x87NPVE\\n\\x851\\x00F\\x86A0(6)  \\nwhere, when PI F1, the project is sufficiently attractive for investment \\nby sponsors. \\nIn Eqs. (4) and (5), CoE and CoD are the favorable rates at which \\nshareholders and banks or other financial institutions would raise the \\ncapital needed for the SPV and discount the FCF during the operational \\nand debt service periods. In 2014, CoE is 6% and above 15%, while CoD \\nis 1.8% and 12.6% in Germany and Greece, respectively (Ecofys et al., \\n2016 ). One underlying reason for this variation might be the toughness \\nand complexity of CoD calculation, in which variables such as financial \\nleverage, loan agreement covenants and country risk are involved \\n(Blanc-Brude and Strange, 2007 ). Because financing through debt is \\nusually cheaper than equity of shareholders (EsteveBorr ˇas et al., 2019 ), \\nshareholders tend to increase financial leverage as much as possible for a \\ntransaction. Mora et al. (EsteveBorr ˇas et al., 2019 ) extracted CoD rates \\nfrom previous offshore wind projects, all of which are financed at \\ndifferent leverage ratios. \\nAs mentioned, country risk strongly influences CoD determination \\n(Blanc-Brude and Strange, 2007 ). In one example, in a study conducted \\nby LAZARD (Lazard, 2018 ), CoD in northern Europe, Australia and \\nJapan for solar PV projects is 8% with a leverage ratio of 60%. Equiv -\\nalent rates in India, Brazil and the US are 13%, 14.5% and 6%, respec -\\ntively. More recently, the value of CoD has been changing globally. One \\nstudy on 133 renewable utility-scale power projects in Germany found \\nthat the value of CoD in the projects with a leverage ratio of 70% \\ndecreased from 5.5% to 1.5% from 2005 to 2017 (Egli et al., 2018 ). \\nIn projects using a non-recursive financing technique to raise money, \\ndevelopers must run the project for years (because of the previously \\ndiscussed risks during this period) to earn a reasonable profit and recover the initial investment. Under such uncertain circumstances, \\nprecise prediction of future cash flow is difficult (Feng et al., 2017 ). \\nNonetheless, when everything goes smoothly, the lender will receive full \\nrepayment of the debt service; however, if SPV vastly exceeds the ex-\\npected performance and earns a great deal of money, the lender will not \\naccrue an increase in financial gain. \\nIf the SPV fails to meet its financial obligations during the opera -\\ntional years, the lender ’s investment is at stake and could suffer a \\ndecrease in full value. Therefore, to avoid such a risk, lenders might \\nrequest sponsors to a create reserve account, or a debt service reserve \\naccount (DSRA), and an operation and maintenance reserve account \\n(OMRA), and to set aside a portion of the FCF to equity (FCFE) every \\nyear before paying dividends for the duration of the loan repayment \\nperiod. Reserve accounts are always available for creditors as a safe-\\nguard against the sponsors ’ lack of liquidity to service debt obligations \\nand lifecycle costs (Gatti, 2018a ). After completion of the financing \\nperiod, all of the money that has been set aside in reserve accounts can \\nbe withdrawn and distributed amongst equity holders. Calculation of \\nDSRA and OMRA is as follows: \\nDSRA t\\x88α×FCF Et\\nt\\x881C\\u200b2C…CTL (7)  \\nOMRA t\\x88β\\x85FCF Et\\x00DSRA t\\x86\\nt\\x881C2C…CTL (8)  \\nwhere DSRA t is the debt service reserve account at time t, OMRA t is the \\noperation and maintenance reserve account at time t, α is the DSRA \\nratio, and β is the OMRA ratio. \\nBecause debt providers will receive reimbursement from the pro-\\nject’s uncertain revenue, accurate modelling of the randomness of the \\noperational cash flow is of utmost importance in the project planning \\nphase (EsteveBorr ˇas et al., 2019 ). There is a need for measures to alle-\\nviate such grave risk from the limited profits and considerable downside \\nrisks for the lender. \\n2.2. Probability of default in project finance \\nCredit risk in project financing transactions is a key measure for \\ncreditors to consider (Gatti et al., 2007 ). Credit risk (CR) in corporate \\nfinance is usually based on the Basel Committee model in which CR \\x88\\nPD ×LGD ×EAD (Basel Committee on Bankin, 2005 ), where PD denotes \\nthe probability of default, LGD denotes loss given default, and EAD \\ndenotes exposure at default. Several models developed around credit \\nrisk have concentrated on measuring PD, which can be calculated using \\nthe structural approach, reduced form approach or hazard rate (Jarrow \\nand Protter, 2004 ). The first structural model is the Merton model \\n(Merton, 1974 )– (Arora et al., 2005 ), which is based on the notion that \\nthe dynamics of the value of assets of a firm (VA) follows geometric \\nBrownian motion and calculates PD as the probability of VA falling \\nbelow the corporate debt value (VD) at time t as follows (Blanc-Brude \\nand Hasan, 2016 ): \\nPD t\\x88N⎢\\n⨀∮lnVA\\nVD\\x87t\\x00\\nu\\x000B5σ2\\nA)\\nσA⎪⎪t♠⎥\\n⨁⨀t\\x881C2C…CTL(9)  \\nwhere PDt is the probability of default at maturity and is evaluated at \\ntime t, N (.) is the cumulative distribution function, u is the mean return, \\nand σA denotes the volatility of a firm’s assets. \\nMoody ’s model (henceforth KMV) has been developed by Vasicek \\n(AlfonsVasicek, 1984 ) as an extension to the Merton model and can \\ndetermine CR (Kealhofer) successfully. Theoretically, the KMV model \\nrests on the premise that default occurs when the assets ’ value di-\\nminishes to a pre-set threshold, called the default point (DP) and results \\nin the borrower ’s failure to meet the debt financial obligation. The \\nnegative quantity inside the parentheses in Eq. (9) is the distance to A. Firouzi and A. Meshkani                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Utilities Policy 70 (2021) 101197\\n4default (DD) and can be calculated as is shown in Eq. (10). The area \\nabove the DD under a standard normal distribution is the PD, as calcu -\\nlated in Eq. (11). \\nDD t\\x88VA\\x85t\\x86\\x00DP\\nVA\\x85t\\x86×σAt\\x881C2C…CTL(10)  \\nPD t\\x88N\\x85\\x00DD t\\x86t\\x881C\\u200b2C…CTL(11) \\nThe KMV model calculates the number of standard deviations the \\nvalue of the assets has from DP. The Merton and KMV models can \\ncalculate default based on the amount of debt and the value of the assets; \\nhowever, in project finance, the default must be calculated based on \\nfuture cash flow rather than asset value. An explicit definition of default \\nmust be identified (Gatti et al., 2007 ; Sorge, 2004 ; Chowdhury et al., \\n2015 ; Moody ’s Investors Service, 2018 ). Accordingly, Blanc-Brude and \\nHasan (2016) developed a model in which the cash available for loan \\nrepayment and debt servicing is considered an asset of the SPV and DP, \\nrespectively. At any time, FCF and DS can be substituted for VA and DP in \\nEq. (10). can can appraise default yearly while determining whether or \\nnot FCF is adequate for servicing the debt. It estimates the distance to \\ndefault by substituting FCF for VA as follows: \\nDD t\\x88FCF t\\x00DS t\\nσFCFt\\x881C\\u200b2C…CTL(12)  \\nwhere FCF t is the FCF at time t, DSt is the debt service at time t, and σFCF \\nis the standard deviation of FCF. \\nThe probability of default and credit ratings in project finance are \\ninterrelated (Kong et al., 2008 ). The credit rating is provided by rating \\nagencies and depict the probability of a project ’s success in timely \\nrepayment of the debt obligation and also addresses the sovereign risk, \\nforce majeure risk, project-level risk and credit enhancements \\n(Thompson, 2012 ). For example, Moody ’s default rate for the Ba3 rating \\ncategory is 2.49% (Moody ’s Investors Service, 2018 ). Lenders and \\nfinancial institutions may set these ratings as a target in negotiations \\nwith sponsors. \\nStudies primarily have focused on the DSCR and loan life coverage \\nratio to control creditor financial concerns (e.g. (Xueqing, 2005 ; Yun \\net al., 2009 ; Borgonovo and Gatti, 2013 ; EsteveBorr ˇas et al., 2019 )). \\nGatti (Gatti et al., 2007 ) has stated that the consideration of credit risk in \\nproject finance transactions is of particular importance for lenders. \\nNevertheless, to the best of the authors ’ knowledge, no research been \\nundertaken using shareholder credit risk and the probability of default. \\n2.3. Energy yield computation in solar PV \\nWhen calculating the energy production of a solar PV power plant, \\nirradiance data (global horizontal irradiance; GHI) can be used as fol-\\nlows: \\nGHI\\x88DHI\\x87DNI×cos\\x85v\\x86 (13)  \\nwhere DHI is diffuse horizontal irradiance, which is the energy received \\nfrom all radiation reflected from the surrounding area or atmosphere \\nonto a unit area of a horizontal surface, DNI is the direct normal irra-\\ndiation, which is the solar beam energy received on a unit area at the \\nsurface that is directly exposed to the sun, and the term ν denotes the \\nsolar zenith angle (Payeras, 2015 ; Kleissl, 2013 ). \\nThe details and model data for DHI and DNI are available in sources \\nsuch as the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System, Solar \\nGeographical Information System, and NASA Surface Meteorology and \\nSolar Energy (NASA SSE). Irradiance data obtained from these sources \\ncan be used to compute the energy yield of a solar PV power plant using \\nonline sources and software packages such as RETSCREEN, SOLARIUS \\nPV, PV*SOL online, HELIOS 3D Solarparkplanung, HOMER 2, and \\nPVsyst. In the present work, the NASA SSE dataset has been used to \\ncollect the data needed. PVsyst is employed to simulate a grid-connected power plant using the extracted data, although the dataset is not suffi-\\nciently accurate. \\nThe efficiency of the modules used in a solar PV power planet usually \\ndecreases over the project lifecycle for several reasons. These include \\nsolar irradiation, voltage bias effects, humidity, temperature and \\nmanufacturing processes (Payeras, 2015 ). A degradation rate should be \\nconsidered for the entire operational period depending on the type of \\npanels used in the power plant. \\n3.Methodology \\nThe optimal debt service schedule is determined, and returns to \\nequity-holders are maximized in four steps. Section 3.1 describes the \\nmethod of computing revenues for solar energy. Section 3.2 introduces \\nMonte Carlo simulation as a method to reveal the effects of uncertain \\nparameters on viability and profitability indices. Section 3.3 introduces \\nthe optimization problem. Sections 3.4 and 3.5 introduce genetic algo-\\nrithms and particle swarm optimization, which are employed to \\nimplement the proposed model ’s optimization and validation processes. \\n3.1. Revenue calculation procedure \\nLong-term GHI data for the location of a project can be extracted \\nfrom relevant sources. NASA SSE data is employed in the current study. \\nPVsyst is used to simulate the first year of energy production of a solar \\nPV power plant. The solar panel degradation rate should be applied \\nannually for the period of operation to calculate the life energy yield of \\nthe project. Because the accuracy of NASA SSE data is questionable, its \\ninfluence on the project ’s revenues should be considered in addition to \\nother risk factors to better approximate shareholder profitability for \\nproject evaluation. By knowing the uncertainty of this dataset, and the \\nrelevant distribution function, the output of PVsyst for the annual mean \\nenergy production can be simulated using Monte Carlo simulation. The \\nsimulated annual energy production can be used to calculate the reve-\\nnue for every year by multiplying the feed-in tariff for annual energy \\nproduction. \\n3.2. Monte Carlo simulation \\nDetermining optimal debt service schedule can be affected by the \\nvarying and dynamic nature of the uncertainties and risks during the \\nproject lifecycle. The effect of uncertain factors can gravely affect the \\ncash flow of the operation. \\nMonte Carlo simulation can be used to simulate the stochastic pro-\\ncess of project activities in both the construction and operation phases \\nwhen the statistical distributions of risky factors have been delineated \\n(Xueqing, 2005 ; KurtH. D. W). The statistical distribution of key finan -\\ncial inputs can be drawn from analogous projects with similar man-\\nagement and procurement activities (Abourizk and Halpin, 1990 ). \\nFollowing the creation of data input from a relative statistical distribu -\\ntion, each set of input data is simulated using a large number of suc-\\ncessive iterations (Marino and Schuermann, 2000 ). The outcome of the \\nsimulation can then be analyzed in order to ascertain the statistical \\ndistribution of key financial indicators as follows: \\nX\\x85k\\x86\\nl\\x88F\\x001\\nxl\\x00\\nr\\x85k\\x86\\nl)\\nk\\x881C2C…CNsiml\\u200b\\x881C2C…CNvar (14)  \\nwhere X\\x85k\\x86\\nl is the simulated deterministic value of Xl in the kth iteration \\nusing the randomly generated value r\\x85k\\x86\\nl and Nsim\\u200band\\u200bNvar are the \\nnumber of iterations and random variables, respectively (Firouzi and \\nKhayyati, 2020 ). In the current work, Monte Carlo simulation is used to \\ndetermine the influence of the uncertain measurements in the NASA SSE \\ndataset as well as risk factors on the revenue (R) and operation expenses \\n(O&M). A. Firouzi and A. Meshkani                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Utilities Policy 70 (2021) 101197\\n53.3. Optimization model \\nIn practice, if FCF changes during the asset ’s operational life, the \\noptimum sculpted debt service profile is derived via a simple deter -\\nministic framework. \\nEq. (1) can be rearranged to determine the principal repayment for \\nperiod t as follows: \\nPt\\x88FCF t\\nDSCR min\\x00It (15) \\nThis equation does not guarantee that the ending balance of debt at \\nthe final repayment date (loan tenor) is zero. Therefore, financial \\nmodelers use the Goal Seek tool in Excel to determine the fixed leverage \\nratio (total debt size) to set the ending debt balance equal to zero. It \\nshould be noted that this deterministic approach implicitly assumes that \\nas the condition DSCR t\\x88DSCR min is satisfied throughout the loan tenor, \\nthe probability of default is within the acceptable range of lenders. \\nThe objective function in this study is the maximization of share -\\nholder PI (Eq. (6)). The debt service amount is the decision variable and \\nvaried throughout the optimization process while satisfying the model \\nconstraints. The constraints are infracted and the solution is counted as \\ninfeasible. The objective function in Eq. (16) and constraints of the \\noptimization model (Eq. (17) - (19)) are: \\nMax\\u200bPI\\u200b\\x881\\x87NPVE\\n\\x851\\x00F\\x86A0(16)     \\nPD t≼acceptable \\u200bPD\\u200brate\\u200bincorporating \\u200bcountry\\u200band\\u200bcommercial \\u200brisk\\n(18)  \\nDS t≽minimum \\u200bacceptable \\u200bannual\\u200bDS\\u200bfor\\u200bcreditors (19) \\nThe merit of the proposed probabilistic optimization framework is \\nthat it explicitly considers the probability of default via Monte Carlo \\nsimulation for any financial leverage. Sponsors prefer and negotiate for \\nhigher financial leverage (debt size). The variable debt service profile is \\nnot uncommon in project finance. For example, to match the debt ser-\\nvice to project free cash flows, both bank loans and bond financing allow \\nsculpting (Guidebook on Financing of, 2016 ). Therefore, subject to the \\nlender ’s permission, it is possible to use variable repayments. This \\noptimization framework can be used to ascertain whether, for the given \\nfinancial leverage, the probability of default throughout the loan tenor \\nwill be less than the lender-determined threshold. \\n3.4. Genetic algorithm \\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a practical solution to implementing the \\nproposed debt service schedule optimization method. A GA is a \\nderivative-free stochastic research algorithm inspired by natural evo-\\nlution, Darwin ’s theory of evolution (Goldberg, 1989 ; Goldberg and \\nHolland, 1988 ) and genetics used to find the best solution. GA randomly \\napplies directed search within a given set of alternatives or possible \\nspace while considering the criteria of goodness or the objective func-\\ntion (Chan et al., 2018 ). \\nGA optimization begins with the initialization in which the first \\npopulation of individuals (chromosomes) is generated randomly within the possible range by genetic coding groups. Next, the individuals are \\nevaluated based upon the objective function and are ranked in \\ndescending order as per their fitness values. The better fitness value \\nreceives a higher rank. The main loop, which comprises selection, \\ncrossover and mutation, begins. \\nRoulette wheel selection is used to select the parents in the crossover \\nstep (Razali and Geraghty, 2011 ). Because each solution ’s genes are real \\nnumbers, an arithmetic crossover is chosen to produce offspring from \\nthe selected parents (Houck et al., 1995 ; Jayalalet al., 2011 ). After \\nevaluation, a merge, sort, and truncate method is utilized to generate the \\nnext new population by merging the initial and offspring populations, \\nare produced using crossover and mutation operators (Mousakazemi \\net al., 2018 ). The number of iterations is selected by trial-and-error \\nbased on the quality of the solutions and objective function conver -\\ngence and is set as the terminate condition of the loop. The GA flowchart \\nis presented in Fig. 1. \\n3.5. Particle swarm optimization \\nParticle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to validate the stability \\nand usefulness of the GA optimization. PSO is a population-based real- \\ncoded optimization technique proposed by Kennedy and Eberhart \\n(1995) . Its fundamental tenet is the simulation of fish shoaling or the \\nforaging behavior of birds to seek the optimal solution through iteration \\nof random solutions. Its precision, swiftness, robustness, and simplicity \\nare the reasons why PSO is commonly used in such research. The major \\nadvantages of PSO were reviewed by Manbachi et al. (2016) . \\nPSO begins with initialization, and the initial population is created \\nrandomly. After this step, the main PSO loop begins. During the evalu -\\nation, the solutions (particles) are assessed using a fitness function to \\ndetermine whether or not the current particle ’s value is smaller or larger \\nthan the best particle value.

In the present study, \\nMonte Carlo simulation, debt schedule optimization and validation are \\ncarried out in MATLAB. \\n4.Worked example \\nTo ascertain the applicability of the proposed methodology, the \\nmodel is applied to a worked example in Tehran, Iran. The data set for \\nlong-term irradiance is extracted for the renewable energy laboratory of \\nShahid Beheshti University (Abbaspour campus; 35•44∕N latitude, \\n51•34∕E longitude). A solar PV project with a capacity of 10 MW was \\nassumed and simulated. \\nThe NASA SSE website is used to gather the diurnal GHIl\\niCj of the \\nassumed location for 35 years (Table 1). The maximum and minimum \\nvalues of the average daily GHI are 7.65 and 2.17 kWh/m2 for June and \\nDecember, respectively. The total annual irradiation is 1817 kWh/m2 \\nand the average GHI is 4.97 kWh/m2. The maximum and minimum \\naverage wind velocity are 2.49 and 1.71 mBs\\x001 in April and December, \\nrespectively. The hottest and coldest months are July and January, with average temperatures of 24 and -2 •C, respectively. \\nThe energy production of a 10 MW solar PV power plant is estimated \\nby simulation in PVsyst. The simulation results (annual solar PV energy \\nyield) are used as the production of the first year. Energy production for \\nthe average operation period is calculated considering the degradation \\nof solar PV modules. \\nBefore computing the cash flow model, assumptions are made for the \\nsake of simplicity, although this did not affect model practicability. We \\nassume that a power purchase contract is available for the operation \\nperiod. The power yielded by the solar PV plant is purchased at a feed-in \\ntariff rate of $0.15/kWh. In renewable energy project finance, the \\noperation period is commonly expected to be 20–25 years (Charles, \\n2015 ). In this work, the project lifespan is stipulated as 20 years, \\nentailing 1 year as the construction period and 19 years as the operation \\nperiod. Other assumed parameters, such as capital cost, operation and \\nmaintenance cost, tax income rate, depreciation rate, CoE, DSRA (α), \\nand OMRA (β), all might vary from country to country and project to \\nproject. \\nThe parameters used for financial modelling are listed in Table 2. In \\naddition to these assumptions, the module used in the solar PV power \\nplant is assumed to be crystalline silicon. The degradation of crystalline \\nsilicon is roughly 0.8% –0.9% (Allouhi et al., 2019 ); therefore, after \\nestimating the first-year power production, an annual degradation rate \\nof 0.9% is assumed to compute the annual power generation. This \\napproach helped to analyze the financial aspects of the solar PV power \\nplant. \\nAs stated, the accuracy of NASA SSE data is insufficient; hence, \\nMonte Carlo simulation is applied to portray the impact of its uncer -\\ntainty on the model. During the simulation, the coefficient of variation \\nof the NASA SSE dataset is considered to be 15% (Pacudan, 2016b ), and \\nthe distribution is assumed to be normal. The mean energy production \\ndata is multiplied by the feed-in tariff rate of $0.15/kWh in annual en-\\nergy production to calculate the mean annual revenue, which has a \\nnormal distribution with a coefficient of variation of 15%. The invest -\\nment cost is estimated by multiplying the power plant ’s total capacity \\nFig. 2.Flow chart for PSO.

By multiplying the O&M costs by the total \\ncapacity of the power plant, the annual mean O&M expenses are \\ncalculated. The simulation for O&M expenses is conducted by assuming \\nthe distribution to be normal with a coefficient of variation equal to \\n10%. \\nThe inputs into the proposed model are separated into deterministic \\nand random variables. The random variables are those that could not be \\nspecified with certainty. We assume that the project would be con-\\nstructed on time within the expected investment cost; hence, investment \\ncost and interest accumulated during construction are both considered \\nto be fixed parameters in order to simplify model computations. Un-\\ncertain parameters, including the mean annual energy production, \\nrevenue and operation expenses obtained based on the PVsyst simula -\\ntion are considered in the form of a probability distribution to conduct a \\nset of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Table 3 shows the uncertain \\nparameters. \\nTo establish an optimized debt service schedule, which must be \\nhigher than the minimum acceptable DS for the creditor (Eq. (18)), a set \\nof 200 iterations is applied to the original financial model with the \\npopulation size of 200 chromosomes as determined by trial-and-error \\n(see section 3). Moody’s Ba3 rating category is assumed; hence, in the \\noptimization model, the maximum acceptable PD for each year as per \\nMoody’s (Moody’s Investors Service, 2018) is considered to be 2.49% \\nover ten years. \\nThe GA parameters in this study are based on the relative GA \\nguidelines found in the literature (Goldberg, 1989), presented in \\nTable 4. To validate the GA optimization model, PSO is implemented, \\nand the results are discussed in section 5. The PSO parameters used in \\nthis work are presented in Table 5, based upon Clerc’s constriction \\nmethod (Poli et al., 2007) and trial-and-error. \\n5.Results and discussions \\nSeveral noteworthy findings are realized using the proposed meth -odology. The project in the working example is constructed at an initial \\ncost of $12, 000, 000 and is financed with 30% equity and 70% debt to \\nbe repaid with the optimized debt service schedule obtained in the \\nproposed method over ten years. To portray the efficiency of the pro-\\nposed model, the optimal solution obtained after 200 iterations of GA \\noptimization (Table 6) are compared. As seen, the optimized debt ser-\\nvice schedule for the initial population with components created \\nrandomly for $700,000 to $2,000,000 resulted in a PImean of 2.9194. \\nIntuitively, it should make sense that to maximize the PI, debt service \\nshould be moved as much as possible to the last years of the loan \\nrepayment period while not breaching the PD, assumed to be 2.49% in \\nthis illustrative case study. In the initial three years, the debt service \\ndecreased to approximately the lower bound of the decision variables \\n($700,000). This lower bound is arbitrarily introduced ensure that in-\\nterest charges and a minimum portion of principle will be paid each \\nyear. The highest debt service is expected to be paid in the middle years \\nof the loan repayment period because there is more cash available than \\nin the last years. After that period to the end of loan maturity, in line \\nwith the reduction in revenue, considering an assumed degradation rate \\nof 0.9%, the project company would have less cash available to service \\nthe debt. The findings demonstrate that, in the initial years of operation, \\nthe PDs are trivial because of the low interest and principal in com-\\nparison with the FCF. In the following years, the PDs increased to the \\nmaximum rate acceptable to creditors. The amounts of PDs for every \\nsingle year during the loan repayment period are shown in Fig. 3. \\nFinally, it should be noted that in the proposed GA optimization \\nframework, other constraints, e.g., grace period, can also be readily \\nincorporated. \\nFig. 4 shows the GA optimization results after 200 iterations. As \\nshown, optimization occurred in each single generation. The model \\nconverged before the 100th iteration, and in this iteration, little \\nimprovement occurred in the reference line, meaning that a stable \\nfitness value is obtained. \\nAs stated, PSO is employed to determine the usefulness and accuracy \\nof GA optimization in this work. The details of the best solutions yielded \\nby PSO are presented in Table 7. The optimal debt service schedule for \\nwhich the constituents are produced randomly within the possible range \\nof debt services resulted in a PImean of 2.9194. Fig. 5 shows that opti-\\nmization occurred in each generation. Although the solutions converged \\nearly in the 60th iteration, the optimized solution is obtained after the \\n180th iteration. Although PSO convergence is better than that of GA, the \\nresult of PSO is consistent with the GA results and both optimization \\nmethods determined the optimized solution with unerring accuracy. The \\noptimized debt service schedules obtained from both optimization al-\\ngorithms and repayment of the project loan are presented in Figs. 6 and \\n7, respectively. \\nBecause the R and O&M expenses are assumed to be undetermined \\nparameters, PI is the random variable. Figs. 8 and 9 show the distribu -\\ntion of PI in GA and PSO, respectively. The details for both optimization \\nalgorithms are presented in Table 8. As seen in Figs. 8 and 9 and Table 8, \\nthe PI distributions are similar and showed equal values in both opti-\\nmization algorithms. \\nThere are interdependencies between statistics of DSCR as a random \\nvariable, probability of default, and the interest rate charge (CoD). As \\nshown in Eq. (2), the free cash flow at time t, i.e., FCF t is itself a function \\nof revenue and operating cost, both of which are uncertain and volatile Table 3 \\nUncertain parameters data.  \\nOperation year Mean production kWh Mean revenue \\n$ Mean O&M \\n$ \\n1 17,416,068.00 2,607,134.39 120,000 \\n2 17,259,323.39 2,580,343.83 120,000 \\n3 17,103,989.48 2,571,630.47 120,000 \\n4 16,950,053.57 2,542,468.77 120,000 \\n5 16,797,503.09 2,520,309.39 120,000 \\n6 16,646,325.56 2,493,432.75 120,000 \\n7 16,496,508.63 2,478,927.85 120,000 \\n8 16,348,040.05 2,452,109.73 120,000 \\n9 16,200,907.69 2,431,839.04 120,000 \\n10 16,055,099.52 2,413,456.65 120,000 \\n11 15,910,603.63 2,382,961.00 120,000 \\n12 15,767,408.20 2,363,057.77 120,000 \\n13 15,625,501.52 2,343,482.91 120,000 \\n14 15,484,872.01 2,323,634.18 120,000 \\n15 15,345,508.16 2,302,731.43 120,000 \\n16 15,207,398.59 2,282,207.84 120,000 \\n17 15,070,532.00 2,262,722.97 120,000 \\n18 14,934,897.21 2,244,452.08 120,000 \\n19 14,800,483.14 2,217,632.18 120,000  \\nTable 4 \\nGA parameters.  \\nParameter Value \\nMaximum number of iterations 200 \\nPopulation size 200 \\nCrossover percentage 0.8 \\nMutation percentage 0.2 \\nMutation rate 0.03 \\nSelection mode Roulette wheel  Table 5 \\nPSO parameters.  \\nParameter Values \\nMaximum number of iterations 200 \\nPopulation size 200 \\nW 2.05 \\nc1  1.4962 \\nc2  1.4962  A.

The statistics of FCF t along with the \\npromised debt service at time t, i.e.DSt, are used to calculate the distance \\nto default, i.e., DDt, and subsequently the probability of default, PDt, as \\nper Eq. (12) and Eq. (11), respectively. According to these equations, a \\ndecrease in expected free cash flow or increase in its volatility increases \\nthe PDt. In reference to Eq. (1), DSCR t is a random variable and dy-\\nnamics of constituents of FCF t determines its statistics as well. \\nFor a given debt service DSt and loan tenor TL, if the expected revenue decreases, there would be a higher probability of default, and hence the \\ncreditors will demand a higher interest charge (CoD). It should be noted \\nwith the increase of CoD, the total amount of interest payments will \\nincrease. Likewise, with a decrease in the mean DSCR or increase in its \\nvolatility given a fixed loan tenor, the number of years with maximum \\npayments to fulfil the constraint of the maximum allowable probability \\nof default, i.e., Eq. (18) will increase as well. The performance and \\nfinancial data of privately financed projects are confidential and not \\nreadily available neither in the academic literature nor the public \\ndomain. However, regardless of the source of data, the presented \\nframework in this study is generic and can be employed for optimization \\nof debt service of any project given its specific data. This area can be \\nexplored in a future line of study. \\n6.Conclusions \\nThe current study proposed a stochastic framework for debt service \\nscheduling in compliance with the maximum endurable probability of \\ndefault of SPV from the creditors ’ perspective. A genetic algorithm is \\ntested on a worked example for a 10 MW solar PV project as an opti-\\nmization tool to determine the applicability of the proposed procedure. \\nThe NASA SSE dataset is employed for extracting the irradiation data. \\nPVsyst software is used to compute project production. The underlying \\nreasons for using the Monte Carlo simulation and the generated revenue \\nare the intrinsic uncertainties in the solar PV project. The random var-\\niables are FCF and DSCR. The results confirm that the proposed opti-\\nmization procedure endowed creditors with the ability to suggest \\noptimized debt service, which could maximize equity-holder profit -\\nability. Moreover, the efficiency and stability of the GA optimization is \\nvalidated by the use of particle swarm optimization.

To avoid \\nexcessive runtime, current design tools typically only utilize hourly data. As such, the variable nature of solar and \\ndemand is often overlooked. Thus, DER designed based on hourly data may result in significant energy shortfalls \\nwhen deployed in real-world conditions. This research introduces a new, fast method for optimizing DER in-\\nvestments and performing dispatch planning to consider intra-hour variability. A novel set of constraints which \\noperate on intra-hour data are implemented in a mixed-integer-linear-program microgrid investment optimi -\\nzation. Variability is represented by the single worst-case intra-hour fluctuation. This allows for fast optimization \\ntimes compared to other approaches tested. Applied to a residential microgrid case study with 5-minute intra- \\nhour resolution, this new method is shown to maintain optimality within 2% and reduce runtime by 98.2% \\ncompared to full-scale-optimizations which consider every time-step explicitly. Applicable to a variety of tech-\\nnologies and demand types, this method provides a general framework for incorporating intra-hour variability \\ninto microgrid design.   \\n1.Introduction \\nMicrogrid implementation is rapidly becoming a common strategy \\nfor entities to reduce energy costs, minimize grid reliance, improve \\nsustainability, and maximize resilience [1]. However, the barrier to \\nimplementation is high. Significant capital investment is required. \\nMicrogrid operation is difficult: robust control schemes capable of \\nintegrating multiple disparate technologies must be implemented. \\nAdditionally, distributed energy resource (DER) generation is difficult to \\npredict. As such, uncertainty in characterizing demand, solar production, and wind production is high. DER generation and demand is \\nalso highly variable. Frequent intra-hour ramping events complicate the \\nmicrogrid design process. Despite these challenges, microgrid adoption \\nis growing worldwide. As of Q3 2020, 7,968 microgrid projects have \\nbeen identified worldwide [2] with the total microgrid market expected \\nto reach $31B by 2027 [3]. \\nTo overcome these challenges and prove project viability, detailed \\nproject planning must be performed [4]. A key aspect of the microgrid \\ndesign process is the techno-economic optimization. In such an analysis, \\ncapital and operational expenses are weighed against the economic \\nbenefit of technology investments such as solar photovoltaics (PV), \\n*Corresponding author. \\nE-mail address: mstadler@xendee.com (M.

To make an informed economic decision, \\nthis analysis must consider detailed demand data, utility tariff infor-\\nmation, local weather conditions, investment costs, regulations, and \\nproject financing parameters. Mixed-Integer-Linear-Programs (MILP) \\nare well suited to efficiently solve this class of optimization problem [5]. \\nSignificant research has been performed to develop and improve \\nmicrogrid planning MILP optimization to address the challenges of \\nmicrogrid adoption. [6] introduces a novel method to couple design \\ndays which allows for seasonal storage to be efficiently incorporated into \\nthe microgrid design problem. [7] incorporates molten core fuel cell \\navailability via a stochastic optimization model. [8] also uses a sto-\\nchastic optimization model to incorporate uncertainty of demand, PV \\nproduction, wind production, and market price. [9] splits the optimi -\\nzation into planning and operation subproblems. Robust optimization is \\nemployed to incorporate the worst-case uncertainty of the input data \\ninto the operation subproblem. [10] leverages a scenario-based uncer -\\ntainty analysis of input data to derive a method of building robust design \\nscenarios to improve optimization robustness. \\nHowever, few studies have addressed the fundamental problem of \\nmicrogrid design considering intra-hour variability. Hourly data, typi-\\ncally the basis of microgrid design, does not sufficiently capture intra- \\nhour demand and solar ramps. Since the microgrid technology mix \\nmust have sufficient system flexibility to respond to such ramping \\nevents, intra-hour variability must be considered in the design phase. \\n[11] and [12] address intra-hour variability by partitioning the \\nplanning problem into hourly and intra-hour timescales to determine \\nthe optimal ESS and fast-ramping generation sizing in a system with \\nexisting wind and thermal generators. Hourly generator scheduling, \\nintra-hour generator adjustments, and ESS dispatch are determined \\nconsidering the power balance for all intra-hour periods. Wind and de-\\nmand uncertainty is introduced as an intra-hour fluctuation that must be \\nmet through additional generator regulation or ESS. For generators, each timescale has an independent cost in the objective function. As \\nsuch, ESS can be sized to minimize costs considering the variability of \\nwind and demand, the ramping capabilities of the existing generator, \\nand the costs of regulation. However, [11] and [12] only provide a \\nframework for optimizing ESS and fast-ramping generation size. \\nImportantly, generation capacity subject to variability is fixed. Addi-\\ntionally, [11] and [12] enforce the power balance on the full set of intra- \\nhour timesteps, which is intractable for high-resolution optimizations. \\nThe study presented here expands on these concepts by optimizing the \\ncapacity of generators subject to variability (e.g. investment sizes are not \\nfixed) and introducing a novel method to capture intra-hour variability \\nwithout increasing the time dimension of the investment optimization \\nmodel, thus improving computational runtime for high-resolution \\nproblems. \\n[13] proposes a framework in which the magnitude of intra-hour net \\nload capacity and ramp magnitude are used as constraints in the \\ngenerator planning problem. At intra-hour temporal resolution, histor -\\nical net load capacity and ramp magnitude are calculated to establish the \\nnet load phase plane (ramp vs. capacity). Next, the phase plane is dis-\\ncretized and flexibility requirements are established as a function of net \\nload capacity. Generator capacity is then optimized using these con-\\nstraints, ensuring that DER investments have sufficient ramping capa-\\nbility to meet the maximum observed intra-hour ramp. Importantly, \\n[13] explicitly ignores the time dimension of the problem and DER \\noperation is not calculated. Furthermore, [13] assumes that wind in-\\nvestments, the primary contributor to net load variability, are fixed and \\nseveral wind penetration scenarios are investigated.

The difference between these \\nscales is the amount of reserve energy required to meet intra-hour \\nvariability at each timestep. The 99th percentile of this distribution is \\nused to modify the minimum state-of-charge of the ESS which ensures \\nsufficient energy is reserved to meet intra-hour variability. [14] shows \\nthis approach to be robust. However, only ESS dispatch constraints are \\nmodified. No considerations are made for additional PV, GEN, or wind \\ncapacity. Furthermore, [14] presents an iterative approach in which \\ncapacities are fixed. In contrast, the present research avoids an iterative \\nprocedure by introducing a new set of constraints in a mixed-integer- \\nlinear-program techno-economic optimization. \\nTo date, there exists no method of optimizing microgrid DER in-\\nvestments considering intra-hour variability without i) modeling each \\nintra-hour timestep explicitly, resulting in intractable runtimes for high- \\nresolution problems, or ii) using an iterative or scenario-based approach \\nin which variable resource DER capacity is fixed and flexible generation \\n(ESS or GEN) capacity and operation are optimized. To address these \\nshortcomings, this paper establishes a new method which optimizes DER \\ncapacity and operation while considering the intra-hour variability of \\ndemand and renewable resources. This is accomplished through a novel \\nset of constraints implemented in a mixed-integer-linear-program \\nframework which enforce the microgrid power balance on the worst- \\ncase intra-hour variability conditions. Importantly, this is accom -\\nplished without increasing the time-resolution of the investment opti-\\nmization. Thus, runtimes are dramatically faster than full-scale \\noptimizations which consider each intra-hour time step explicitly. When \\ncompared to full-scale optimizations, little loss in objective function \\noptimality is observed. This model is demonstrated for a sample resi-\\ndential microgrid project to determine the optimal DER which meet \\nelectrical demand, but is also generally applicable to other demands \\nsuch as cooling, heating, or natural gas load. \\nThe contributions of this paper to microgrid optimization literature \\nare:  \\n≡A DER sizing model is developed which incorporates intra-hour \\nvariability without increasing the time-dimension of the optimiza -\\ntion problem  \\n≡A general framework for optimizing microgrid sizing and dispatch \\nconsidering intra-hour variability is established which dramatically \\nimproves runtime compared to existing methods  \\n≡A novel set of constraints which are widely applicable to microgrid \\ntechnologies, demand types, and case studies are developed \\nThis paper is organized as follows.

Description of model \\nThe techno-economic engine of the XENDEE platform [4] is modeled \\nafter the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER- \\nCAM) [15] which is well-established for DER optimization problems \\n[16] and includes numerous developments such as optimizing DER \\nsizing considering building retrofits [17]. XENDEE includes modelling \\nimprovements which consider multiyear analyses [18], incorporate \\nmultiple financing schemes [19], and implement an efficient but robust \\nhybrid method to improve optimization performance [20]. The model uses a mixed-integer-linear-program (MILP) to minimize \\nthe equivalent annual cost (EAC) of the net present cost of the microgrid \\nover a defined project lifetime (PL) (Eq. (1)). When total annual costs \\n(capital costs (CAPEX ) and operational expenses (OPEX )) are invariant \\nw.r.t. year and the discount rate (DiscRate ) is assumed to be 0%, [19] \\nshows that the objective function is equivalent to minimizing single year \\nEAC (Eq. (2)). For this study, CAPEX is amortized over the technology \\nlifetime LT assuming an interest rate of 5% (Eq. (3)) rather than PL. As \\nsuch, CAPEX represents the annual capital costs incurred to reinvest in \\nthe technology ad infinitum – project length is irrelevant. This approach \\nis equivalent to the annualized energy cost optimization as described in \\n[17]. \\nThe model can consider various forms of input data, including \\ncontinuous time-series data or peak preserving representative days \\n[20,21] . Though power flow is not considered in this study, the model \\ncan utilize a lossy DistFlow model [22] to model power flow on up to a \\ntwenty node network. This is sufficient to accurately model any complex \\ndistribution system [23,24] . Additionally, the techno-economic model is \\ncapable of analyzing several value streams not explored in this study \\nsuch as resilience, redundancy, tax incentives, energy exports, renew -\\nable certificates, and energy management strategies. \\nminEAC BDiscRate\\n1\\x00\\x851\\x87DiscRate\\x86\\x00PL×̂PL\\ny\\x880[CAPEX\\n\\x851\\x87DiscRate\\x86y\\n\\x87OPEX\\n\\x851\\x87DiscRate\\x86y]\\n(1)  \\nminEAC BCAPEX\\x87OPEX (2)  \\nCAPEX\\x88̂\\nT∃DERi⌊\\n1\\x001\\n\\x851\\x87i\\x86LT⌋∙\\x85FCT⋅ξT\\x87VCT⋅Capacity T\\x86 (3)  \\nOPEX\\x88ctariff\\x87cfuel\\x87cO&M\\x87ccurtail\\x87cCO2\\x00rsales (4) \\nFor discrete technologies such as generators and inverters, Capacity T \\nis equal to the discrete number of units purchased multiplied by the \\nnameplate capacity of the technology (MAXP T).

While this research focuses on electricity, these \\nconstraints can be expanded to consider multiple end-uses such as \\ncooling, heating, or natural gas loads. The energy balance (Eq. (5)) states \\nthat for each timestep the sum of energy produced or consumed across \\nall technologies (Em,d,h,j,T , kWh) and utility energy purchases (Um,d,h,j , \\nkWh) must equal the energy exported to the grid (Xm,d,h,j , kWh) plus the \\nsum of power demand (Lm,d,h,j , kW), load curtailment (Cm,d,h,j , kW) and \\nthe net demand adjustment from load shifting (Nm,d,h,j , kW) multiplied \\nby the optimization timestep (Δt, h). Throughout this analysis, demand \\n(L, C, N) is expressed in terms of power (kW) regardless of model reso-\\nlution. As such, the model timestep (Δt) must be included in the energy \\nbalance. This analysis only considers islanded microgrids in which no \\nenergy management strategies are considered. Thus, utility purchases, \\nexports, curtailment, and load shifting terms are zero (Eq. (6)). \\nHere, timestep indices are denoted by month (m), day (d), hour (h), \\nand intra-hour index (j). d can be a representative set of days or the full P. Mathiesen et al.

PV energy output is limited by the \\nsolar performance (Sm,d,h,j , kWdc/kW dc,capacity Section 4.1) at each \\ntimestep and cannot be greater than the selected PV inverter capacity \\n(Eq. (7)). ESS energy throughput is equal to the model timestep multi -\\nplied by the power charged/discharged by the battery (Km,d,h,j , kW) \\nconsidering discharge and inverter efficiencies (Eq. (8)). The maximum \\nESS charge/discharge rate (CESS, h\\x001) and ESS capacity (kWh) limits K \\n(Eq. (9)). Like PV, ESS energy production is limited by the inverter ca-\\npacity (Eq. (10)). Unlike other technologies, ESS can consume energy \\nwhen charging and Em,d,h,j,ESS may be negative. \\nThe ESS state-of-charge (SOC, kWh) is a time linked variable in \\nwhich the SOC is equal to the SOC at the previous time-step plus the \\nenergy discharged/charged from the ESS Eq. (11) and is limited by the \\nESS capacity and minimum/maximum allowable state of charge Eq. \\n(12). SOC has a circular lag dependency (indicated by “–1” notation), \\ntreating the last and first elements of a set as consecutive elements. \\nParentheses indicate that the circular lag is only applied if the next \\nlower-level index is the first in the set (e.g. m \\x882, d \\x881, h \\x881, j \\x881 links \\nto m \\x881, d \\x8831, h \\x8824, j \\x88τ). For optimizations with representative \\ndaytypes, the circular lag on month and day indices are dropped; the last \\nhour of a day is linked with the first hour of the same day. SOC is also \\nconstrained by the physical minimum and maximum limits of the ESS. \\nFinally, the energy provided from GEN must be less than the number \\nof generators operating at the timestep (Om,d,h,j , #) multiplied by the \\ngenerator nameplate capacity Eq. (13). Although available, no con-\\nstraints on minimum loading percentage, minimum uptime, or \\nmaximum operating hours over the year were considered. \\nEmCdChCjCPV≼Δt∙min\\x00\\nSmCdChCj∙Capacity PVCCapacityPVInv)\\n∙ηInv (7)  \\nEmCdChCjCESS\\x88Δt∙KmCdChCj∙ηESS⋅ηInv (8)  ⃦⃦KmCdChCj⃦⃦≼CapacityESS∙CESS (9)  \\n⃦⃦EmCdChCjCESS⃦⃦≼Δt∙Capacity ESSInv ⋅ηInv (10)  \\nSOC mCdChCj\\x88SOC m\\x85\\x00\\x001\\x86Cd\\x85\\x00\\x001\\x86Ch\\x85\\x00\\x001\\x86Cj\\x00\\x001\\x87KmCdChCj∙Δt (11)  \\nMinSOC∙Capacity ESS≼SOC mCdChCj≼MaxSOC∙Capacity ESS (12)  \\nEmCdChCjCGEN≼Δt∙OmCdChCj⋅MAXP GEN (13)  \\n2.3. Intra-hour electric power balance \\nTo consider intra-hour variability, a second balance equation Eq. \\n(14) is introduced. Fig. 1 presents a visual representation of this concept. \\nHere, the observed 15-minute resolution data (left hand side of Fig. 1a/ \\nb) shows intra-hour demand and solar production variability. When \\naveraged over the hour (right hand side), variability is smoothed but \\ntotal energy content (number of shaded bricks in Fig. 1) remains the \\nsame. Thus, the energy balance (Eq. (5)) can be enforced using hourly- \\naverage profiles. However, DER sized based on the energy balance alone \\nare insufficient to meet intra-hour demand spikes. In the example below, \\nhourly PV production (Em,d,h,PV ) is large enough to meet hourly-average \\ndemand (LmCdCh) but is inadequate to fulfill the maximum intra-hour \\ndemand. As such, intra-hour variability must be considered in the \\noptimization problem to determine DER capacity. \\nHere, intra-hour variability is defined by the worst-case conditions of \\nthe intra-hour. This consists of i) the maximum observed intra-hour \\ndemand (max\\nj∃τLmCdChCj, kW, Fig. 1a) and ii) the minimum intra-hour solar \\nproduction considering PV and inverter capacity (Be\\nm,d,h,PV , kW, Eq. \\n(15), Fig. 1b). The intra-hour power balance Eq. (14) states that there \\nmust be sufficient electric balancing power (Be\\nm,d,h,T , kW) across all \\ntechnologies to meet the maximum intra-hour electric demand (kW). In \\nthe case below, though PV can meet the hourly-average demand, Be\\nm,d,h, \\nPV is insufficient to meet the intra-hour power balance and either GEN or \\nESS must be deployed and operated to ensure that energy shortfalls do \\nnot occur. \\n̂\\nT∃DERBe\\nmCdChCT≽max\\nj∃τLmCdChCj (14)  \\nBe\\nmCdChCPV⩽min[\\nmin\\nj∃τSmCdChCj⋅Capacity PVCCapacity PVInv]\\n⋅ηInv (15) \\nSince intra-hour variability is represented by a single value, the \\npower balance constraint is agnostic to intra-hour timescale (Δτ). \\nTherefore, this method can be applied to any intra-hour timescale \\nwithout increasing the dimension of the hourly techno-economic in-\\nvestment problem. Here, Δτ describes the resolution of the intra-hour \\nvariability and Δt describes the optimization time-step size (typically \\nhourly). Table 1 (Section 3.4) describes how Δt and Δτ are defined for \\nthe case study presented here. Only during the high-resolution dispatch \\nstage (Section 3.4) does the time-dimension of the problem increase. \\nSeveral assumptions are required to reduce variability to a single \\nevent. First, the power balance constraint does not consider the timing \\nand alignment of intra-hour spikes. Instead, a significant assumption is \\nthat the worst-case solar and demand spikes occur simultaneously. \\nSecond, when intra-hour variability is observed, a corresponding de-\\nmand or solar spike in the opposite direction must also exist somewhere \\nwithin the hour. When these opposite spikes are averaged, the hourly \\naverage profile from the energy balance is recreated. This ensures that \\ntotal energy is conserved (Fig. 1, diagonal cross-hatched boxes). For \\ndemand, the minimum intra-hour demand is not considered in the \\noptimization problem. However, for solar, there must be sufficient PV \\ninverter capacity to accept the maximum positive solar production spike \\nEq. (16). Since only a single intra-hour timestep is used in the optimi -\\nzation problem, the positive solar spike magnitude is assumed to be Table 1 \\nDescription of sets and timescales used for all approaches in a 5-min \\noptimization.  \\nStage d Δt \\n[min] J Δτ \\n[min] τ \\nRO \\nRO {representative} 60 {1} – – \\nFinal (Dispatch \\nOnly) {all days} 5 {1,2, \\n…,12} – –  \\nPB \\nRO {representative} 60 {1} – – \\nPB Constraints {all days} 60 {1} 5 {1,2, \\n…,12} \\nFinal (Dispatch \\nOnly) {all days} 5 {1,2, \\n…,12} – –  \\nMIO \\nRO {representative} 60 {1} – – \\nFinal (Dispatch \\nand Sizing) {all days} 5 {1,2, \\n…,12} – –  \\nFSO \\nFinal (Dispatch \\nand Sizing) {all days} 5 {1,2, \\n…,12} – –  P.

Runtime, \\noptimality (ratio of the objective function to the benchmark objective \\nfunction), total unfulfilled energy, and technology capacities are \\ncompared. Additionally, dispatch profiles are analyzed. Four approaches \\nare compared (Fig. 3) for each timescale: \\n3.1. Representative optimization (RO) \\nThe representative optimization (RO) is a single stage optimization \\nin which all time-based inputs (e.g. load) are downsampled to three \\nrepresentative days (daytypes) per month at 60-min temporal resolution \\n(Δt \\x8860-min, j \\x88{1}) [21]. RO uses three daytypes for each month to \\nrepresent demand: week, weekend, and peak. Week and weekend day-\\ntypes are calculated by averaging all week (or weekend) days from the \\nhourly demand profile as a function of hour of day. The peak daytype is \\ncreated by taking the maximum demand observed in each hour over the \\nmonth. All weather-based inputs (e.g. solar) use the monthly average by \\nhour of day for all daytypes. \\n3.2. Full scale optimization (FSO) \\nA full-scale optimization (FSO) serves as the benchmark method. FSO \\nsolves the optimization on the full set of m, d, h, and j for the timescale of \\ninterest. As such, intra-hour variability is inherently considered and the \\npower balance constraints are not needed. FSO is a single stage opti-\\nmization – investments and dispatch decisions are optimized simulta -\\nneously. Therefore, runtime is expected to be long, especially for high \\nresolutions in which many binary decisions (e.g. ESS charge/discharge) \\nmust be made for each timestep. \\nFig. 1.Visual schematic of power balance variables for demand (a) and PV production (b) demonstrating the relationship between intra-hour variability and the \\nhourly average. The optimization timescale (Δt) is 1 h and the power-balance timescale (Δτ) is 15 min. The white brick (b, square cross-hatch) demonstrates how the \\nmagnitude of the assumed positive solar spike is derived. \\nFig. 2.Visual schematic of EESS demonstrating the relationship between intra- \\nhour variability and the hourly average.

Applied Energy 304 (2021) 117777\\n63.3. Minimum investment optimization (MIO) \\n[20] introduced the Minimum Investment Optimization (MIO). MIO \\nis a stage-based optimization. The first stage is the RO. The RO solution \\nis then used to set a lower bound on investment decisions for the final \\nstage. In the final stage, the full time-series input dataset at the timescale \\nof interest is used. Thus, d is expanded to all days in each month and j to \\nthe number of intra-hour timesteps (Table 1). The final stage optimi -\\nzation invests in additional DER as required to fulfill the energy balance. \\nThis guarantees robustness but not a runtime reduction when compared \\nto FSO. As shown in [20], however, runtime reduction is consistently \\nobserved in the researched cases. Additionally, MIO does not guarantee \\noptimality. It is possible for RO to oversize DER investments, resulting in \\nsuboptimal MIO. For both stages, power balance constraints are \\ndisabled. \\n3.4. Power balance optimization (PB) \\nThe power balance optimization (PB) improves on MIO by adding an \\nintermediate stage to finalize investment decisions considering intra- \\nhour variability. PB is a three-stage process. Like MIO, RO is run as a \\nfirst stage to determine the minimum investment bounds for the second- \\nstage time-series optimization. In the second stage, an hourly time-series \\noptimization is performed with power balance constraints enabled \\n(Section 2.3) to determine the investments required to fulfill intra-hour \\ndemand at the timescale of interest. Importantly, the power balance \\nstage is always an hourly optimization, but considers the demand and \\nsolar variability of the timescale of interest as described in Eqs. (14) – \\n(20). Finally, investments are fixed in the third stage and dispatch de-\\ncisions are optimized at the timescale of interest (e.g. intra-hour). \\nTable 1 summarizes how set definitions and timescales change for \\neach stage of a 5-min PB optimization. This stands in contrast to MIO in \\nwhich investment and dispatch decisions are both optimized at the \\ntimescale of interest. Thus, PB runtimes are expected to improve, even \\nwhen the extra intermediate stage is considered. \\nIn addition, the effect of the intermediate power balance stage on the \\nenergy balance will be analyzed by disabling the power balance con-\\nstraints and fixing the RO-derived investment decisions in the dispatch \\nstage at the timescale of interest (denoted as RO-Sized ). This will \\ndetermine the amount of unfulfilled energy that occurs due to intra-hour \\nvariability. \\n4.Case-study \\n4.1. Description of the case study \\nThe case study used to evaluate PB is a theoretical low-voltage res-\\nidential microgrid project considering PV, ESS, and GEN (Fig. 4). PV and ESS are AC-coupled with independent inverters for each technology. \\nTechnology investment is not forced. If uneconomical, the optimization \\nengine may find a solution that does not include one or more of the \\nconsidered technologies. All technologies and loads are connected to a \\ncommon bus using the copper-plate assumption. Thus, connections are \\nassumed to have unlimited capacity. Load data is derived from the Pecan \\nStreet Dataport [26]. [26] provides appliance level demand data at 1- \\nminute resolution. In this study, only electric loads were considered. A \\nsingle anonymous residential site was selected and annual energy con-\\nsumption scaled to 2 GWh. For each scale, load was temporally aver-\\naged, reducing variability and peak demand (Table 2). Demand \\nvariability is measured by comparing subtracting the peak intra-hour \\ndemand to the hourly average demand within the same hour (a “de-\\nmand spike ” relative to the hourly average). As scale decreases, the \\nmagnitude of intra-hour demand spikes increases (Fig. 5a). At the 30- \\nmin timescale, demand spikes are small and infrequent. The maximum \\ndemand spike is 453 kW and they exceed 200 kW for only 2.0% of all \\nhours. In contrast, demand spikes at the 5-min time scale are large. \\nFig. 3.Comparison of stages for the approaches compared in this study. Each box represents an optimization stage.

This in-\\ndicates the presence of intermittent demand spikes which are brief in \\nduration but large in magnitude (see Fig. 6). At longer timescales, the \\nmagnitude of this intermittent variability is averaged and not accurately \\nrepresented in the standard investment optimization problem. \\nThe University of California, San Diego ’s Decision Making using \\nReal-time Observations for Environmental Sustainability (DEMROES) \\nirradiance network [27] was used to derive solar production data. First, \\n1 s global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data was averaged to 1-min res-\\nolution. GHI was partitioned into direct and diffuse components using \\nthe DISC model [28]. Plane-of-array global irradiance was calculated via \\nthe Perez transposition model [29]. Next, PVLIB [30] functions were \\nused to convert plane-of-array global irradiance to power given basic \\ntechnology assumptions (Table 3) and assuming a simple maximum \\npower point model. Thermal efficiency losses were included via a co-\\nefficient of \\x000.47 % C\\x001. All other DC losses were approximated via a \\nbulk 14% loss. For the given irradiance data, total solar yield of a generic \\nPV system is 1547 kWh dc,produced /kW dc,capacity . Like load, data was \\naveraged for each time scale. Here, solar variability is defined as the \\nmaximum intra-hour production shortfall relative to the hourly mean \\nproduction. This corresponds to the balancing power available from \\nsolar (Eq. (15), Fig. 1). Like load, the magnitude of intra-hour fluctua -\\ntion increases with decreasing scale. At the 30-min timescale, solar \\npower shortfalls of 0.1 kWdc,produced /kW dc,capacity occur for 3.0% of all \\nhours (Fig. 5b). This increases to 21.0% of all hours at the 5-min time-\\nscale, indicating that intermittent cloud cover is not properly accounted \\nfor the in hourly optimization. As such, if the intra-hour power balance \\nis not considered, the likelihood of intra-hour solar production shortfalls \\nis large. \\nThe cost assumptions for this case study are given in Table 3 [31,32] . \\nInverter and ESS discharge losses are ignored. A maximum charging rate \\nof 3 h\\x001 is chosen to ensure that the ESS is unconstrained by physical ESS \\ncharging limitations. \\nAll optimizations were performed on a cloud server with an AMD \\nRyzen 5 3600 Hexa-Core processor with 64 GB DDr4 RAM and 2 ×512 \\nGB NVMe SSD. \\n5.Results and discussion \\nThe 60-min RO-Sized (RO \\x87Fixed Dispatch, no intra-hour variability \\nconstraints) finds that 1100 kW of GEN, 419 kWdc/300 kWac of PV, and \\n453 kWh/300 kW of ESS fulfill the hourly electric load at the lowest \\nannualized cost. July 29 provides an example for a typical summer day \\n(Fig. 6a). During the daylight hours, load is low and fulfilled entirely \\nthrough PV and GEN. Excess PV generation in hours 11 and 12 charge \\nthe ESS (red-dashed line, right-hand axis), which is subsequently \\ndeployed in hours 21 and 22 when PV generation is zero and load ex-\\nceeds generator capacity. In Fig. 6, the grey-dashed line shows the total dispatchable capacity \\nin each timestep. This is the available power that can be deployed to \\nmeet demand given hourly PV production, ESS state-of-charge, ESS \\ninverter size, and total generator capacity. Maximum dispatchable ca-\\npacity occurs in hour 13 at 1554 kW (154 kW PV, 75.3% ESS SOC \\x88318 \\nkWh, 300 kW ESS inverter, and 1100 kW GEN). In hour 21, the total \\ndispatchable capacity is 1400 kW (0 kW PV, 75.3% ESS SOC \\x88318 kWh, \\n300 kW ESS inverter, and 1100 kW GEN) and the peak demand of \\n1143.5 kW is met. For no hours of the day does demand exceed available \\npower. \\nHowever, when the same technology capacities are fixed and \\ndispatch optimized at a 5-min scale, it becomes apparent that total \\ndispatchable capacity is insufficient to meet demand (Fig. 6b). Signifi -\\ncant load spikes exist at a 5-min scale which are averaged out at 60-min \\nscales (Fig. 6a). For the 5-min timescale, peak load is 2033.1 kW at \\n21:15. As dispatchable assets total 1400 kW in hour 21, insufficient total \\ncapacity exists to meet peak demand. Unfulfilled demand is represented \\nby the salmon-colored bars in Fig. 6b. Annually, the total energy left \\nunfilled due to insufficient power capacity for RO-Sized at 5-min reso-\\nlution is equal to 751.9 kWh (Table 4). As such, a 60-min energy balance \\nis insufficient to determine the capacity required to meet demand at \\nintra-hour timescales. \\nWhen the intra-hour power balance constraints are considered (PB), \\ntechnology investments meet demand at every 5-min time-step for July \\n29 (Fig. 6c). PB determines that an ESS size of 453 kWh/1000 kW is \\nrequired to meet intra-hour demand. All other technology investments \\nremain unchanged. With 1000 kW ESS inverter capacity, total dis-\\npatchable capacity in hour 21 increases to 2100 kW which exceeds the \\npeak demand of 2033.31 kW. This allows for demand to be met and \\nresults in no unfulfilled energy for this day. \\nAdditionally, PB drastically changes the ESS dispatch behavior \\ncompared to the 60-min dispatch in non-peak hours. As in the 60-min \\ndispatch, PV exceeding demand during daylight hours is used to \\ncharge the ESS. However, in the 5-min load profile, there exist inter-\\nmittent demand spikes that exceed 800 kW for 10–15 min durations. For \\nthese periods, ESS now has sufficient inverter capacity to meet intra- \\nhour demand. With each spike the SOC drops, eventually to the mini-\\nmum by 16:00 (Fig. 6c). Consequently, GEN must be used to charge the \\nESS in hours 20 and 21 immediately before the peak demand (Fig. 6c). \\nAt the 60-min scale, the intermittent demand spikes are averaged out \\nand a combination of PV and GEN are able to meet demand, allowing the \\nESS to maintain its maximum SOC prior to peak demand. Table 4 \\nsummarizes the optimal technology investment of all compared methods \\nas a function of scale. As the magnitude of intra-hour demand spikes \\nincrease, so must total balancing capacity Eq. (14). For this case, PB \\nfinds it is most economical to increase balancing capacity by increasing \\nthe ESS inverter investment. Effectively, the intermittent demand spikes \\nrequire a faster discharging battery. Thus, PB invests in a 0.45 h ESS, \\nFig. 5.Exceedance probability distributions of maximum intra-hour load (a) and minimum intra-hour solar production (b) relative to the hourly mean for 60-min \\n(60 m), 30-min (30 m), 15-min (15 m), 5-min (5 m), and 1-min (1 m) time scales. At finer resolution timescales, the probability of larger intra-hour load and solar \\nvariability spikes increases. P.

The red (RO-Sized ) \\nand brown (PB) vertical lines show the maximum balancing capacity of \\neach scenario. As the magnitude of demand and solar spikes increase, \\nthe frequency of timesteps for which RO-Sized balancing capacity is \\ninsufficient to meet demand increases. For PB, however, extra ESS \\ninverter investment results in no demand spikes which exceed balancing \\ncapacity. \\n[20] introduced MIO which guarantees robustness but not runtime \\nsavings. Table 4 confirms that no unfulfilled energy was observed for \\nMIO optimizations using this case. In fact, PB and MIO optimizations \\nproduced identical DER investments and total annual costs. As such, PB \\noptimality did not improve over MIO (Table 4). For all scales, optimality \\nis within 5%. As scale decreases, optimality improves. At the 5-min, PB \\noptimality is within 1.8% of FSO. \\nIt is important to note that incorrectly sizing in the RO stage will \\nproduce suboptimal PB and MIO results. Since RO uses an “artificial ” \\npeak demand profile constructed from the maximum across each hour, the monthly peak is may be overly conservative. \\nFig. 8 compares the “peak daytype ” (solid line) to July 29th (dashed \\nline), the single day in July which contains the monthly peak demand \\n(July 29th 21:00). Daytype demand is high throughout the day. Thus, \\nGEN are well suited to meet demand as their utilization is high for all \\nhours. In contrast, July 29th demand is low for most hours. GEN sized \\nbased on July 29 would have low utilization in hours 0–20. Further -\\nmore, since total energy consumption is lower (5.5 MWh to 15.2 MWh \\nfor the “peak daytype ”) ESS capacity would be comparatively small. \\nTherefore, for this case study, methods which use the representative \\npeak daytype (e.g. RO) favor generator investment over ESS while \\nmethods that rely on real data (FSO) favor ESS investment. \\nTherefore, for MIO and PB, the first-stage RO over-sizes generator \\ninvestments and under-sizes ESS when compared to the FSO (Table 4). \\nSince RO serves as a lower limit on investments sizes for MIO and PB, \\nDER capacity will not match between MIO, PB, and FSO. Despite this, PB \\noptimality is within 2% at the 5-min timescale. This indicates that a wide \\nrange of DER capacities produce similar total costs. \\nThough PB did not improve on optimality over MIO, PB runtime at \\nsmaller timescales is significantly less than MIO (Table 4). Regardless of \\ndispatch timescale, PB makes final investment decisions during the 60- \\nmin sizing stage. Only dispatch decisions such as ESS charging de-\\ncisions and generator deployment are optimized at the timescale of in-\\nterest. In contrast, MIO must make final investment and dispatch Table 4 \\nCapacity [kW] or [kWh], annual unfulfilled energy [kWh], objective function (total annual costs) [k$], optimality [–], and runtime [min] comparison as a function of \\ntimescale [min].  \\nDispatch Scale [min] Sizing Scale [min] PV [kW dc/kW ac] ESS [kWh/kW] GEN [kW] Annual Unfulfilled Energy [kWh] OF [k$] O [–] Runtime [min]  \\nRO \\n5 60 419/300 453/300 1100 751.9 – – 16.7 \\n15 60 419/300 453/300 1100 294.9 – – 7.4 \\n30 60 419/300 453/300 1100 11.5 – – 2.8 \\n60 60 419/300 453/300 1100 0 764.8 1.046 1.6   \\nPB \\n5 60 419/300 453/1000 1100 0 772.3 1.018 19.6 \\n15 60 419/300 453/700 1100 0 769.6 1.018 7.5 \\n30 60 419/300 453/400 1100 0 766.8 1.040 3.4 \\n60 60 419/300 453/300 1100 0 764.8 1.046 3.1   \\nMIO \\n5 5 419/300 453/1000 1100 0 772.3 1.018 23.7 \\n15 15 419/300 453/700 1100 0 769.6 1.018 15.4 \\n30 30 419/300 453/400 1100 0 766.8 1.040 2.3 \\n60 60 419/300 453/300 1100 0 764.8 1.046 1.7   \\nFSO \\n5 5 531/400 1041/1300 800 0 758.8 – 1063.9 \\n15 15 536/400 1037/1000 800 0 755.8 – 74.6 \\n30 30 500/400 906/700 800 0 737.6 – 7.1 \\n60 60 552/400 1097/700 700 0 731.2 – 3.9  \\nFig. 7.Net demand [kW] (demand – solar) frequency [%] at 60-min (60 m), \\n30-min (30 m), 15-min (15 m), and 5-min (5 m) scales.

A novel set of constraints which enforce \\nthe microgrid power balance on the worst-case conditions of intra-hour \\nvariability are introduced. PB is a staged model. First, an hourly opti-\\nmization using a representative set of days sets the lower bound on in-\\nvestment decisions. Second, the power balance constraints are included \\nto consider intra-hour variability. The optimization is extended to all \\ndays at hourly resolution. In the final stage, DER capacities are fixed and \\ndispatch decisions are optimized at the timescale of interest. Impor -\\ntantly, intra-hour variability is included without increasing the time- \\ndimension of the techno-economic investment problem. Thus, run-\\ntimes are exceptionally faster than full-scale-optimizations of compa -\\nrable resolutions without a significant loss in optimality. \\nPB is validated using a sample residential microgrid case study at \\ntimescales of 5-min, 15-min, 30-min, and 60-min. As timescale de-\\ncreases, ESS inverter investments increase to provide the balancing \\npower required to meet intermittent demand spikes. PB results are \\ncompared to the minimum investment optimization and a full-scale- \\noptimization. For all scales, optimality is within 5% of the full-scale- \\noptimization. For 5-min and 15-min scales, optimality improves to \\nwithin 2%. Runtime improvement is also demonstrated. At 5-min reso-\\nlution, PB runtime is only 1.8% of the full-scale-optimization and im-\\nproves on the minimum investment optimization by 4.1 min. Notably, \\nthe choice of representative daytype in the initial stage will have a \\nsignificant impact on the final PB investment decision. For the presented \\ncase, the representative peak daytype may be overly conservative, \\nresulting in DER investment decisions that favor generator investment \\nover ESS investment. Though unfulfilled energy was not observed for the presented case, \\nPB cannot generally guarantee a robust solution for the high-resolution \\ndispatch stage. The investment sizing stage of PB only considers vari-\\nability magnitude and not intra-hour timing. Therefore, in the high- \\nresolution dispatch stage, the potential exists for energy shortfalls in \\nhours in which timing is important. This is evident when PV curtailment \\nis considered. Consider an hourly energy balance in which PV meets \\ndemand and the ESS state of charge is at capacity. In the high-resolution \\noptimization, a positive solar spike exists in the first intra-hour timestep. \\nIn this scenario, PV production exceeds demand and the ESS cannot \\naccept energy. Therefore, PV production must be curtailed. This \\nremoves energy from the system that exists in the hourly optimization. \\nLater within the same hour, PV production is lower than the hourly \\naverage and insufficient to meet demand. Therefore, ESS must be dis-\\npatched to meet demand and offsetting the energy removed via PV \\ncurtailment. At the end of the hour, ESS state-of-charge is depleted \\nwhich may lead to energy shortfalls later. Conversely, when a large solar \\ndeficit is observed in the first intra-hour timestep, ESS is also deployed to \\nmeet demand. However, the ESS can recharge via the positive solar spike \\nobserved later in the hour, preserving the initial hourly energy balance. \\nAlthough robustness cannot be guaranteed, annual unfulfilled energy \\nwill be small for most practical cases. \\nAs is standard in Microgrid and DER planning algorithms, this \\nmethod assumes that input time-series profiles are known a priori \\n(typically derived from historic data). As such, technology investments \\nand dispatch decisions are optimized without considering uncertainty in \\nthe input data. Thus, optimized sizing may not produce the projected \\nresults when deployed in the field, especially when paired with inac-\\ncurate operational forecasting. Importantly, however, this method mit-\\nigates the risks of misaligned input data or intra-hour forecasting error. \\nSince the algorithm only considers the worst cast spike of intra-hour \\nvariability, so long as the magnitude of intra-hour spikes are predicted \\nwith accuracy, uncertainty in the timing of such events will not impact \\nthe optimal dispatch decisions. For that reason, the authors believe this \\nmethod faces the same challenges as other hourly resolution planning \\nalgorithms, but potentially improves over explicit intra-hour resolution \\ntechniques which plan around each distinct time-step. Note, specific \\nresults exploring the impact of uncertainty are not tested in this paper. \\nFinally, similar intra-hour PB constraints are easily extended to wind \\nproduction, solar thermal energy capture, or heat producing \\nFig. 9.Comparison of runtime components [min] as a function of scale.

Percentage values show runtime reduction compare to FSO. P.

Hence, it is\\nessential to protect the information within these systems and the\\navailability of the computer systems. However, the increase in\\norganizational dependence on information systems as well as the\\nease of mounting attacks has led to a corresponding increase in the\\nnumber of security incidents and damage caused [26]. A computer\\nsecurity incident is de ﬁned as a security-related adverse event in\\nwhich there is a loss of information con ﬁdentiality, disruption of\\ninformation or system integrity, disruption or denial of system\\navailability, or violation of any computer security policies [19].\\nAccording to the 2007 annual survey conducted by the ComputerSecurity Institute [36], 46% of respondents indicated that their\\norganization experienced a security incident within the last\\n12 months. Of these, a signi ﬁcant number (52%) of the attacks are\\nvirus-related. It is therefore important for organizations and employ-\\nees to be aware of and protect themselves against security threats and\\ncybercrime.\\nChung et al. [8]described three approaches at a national level to\\nﬁght against cybercrime, i.e., legal, organizational, and technological.\\nCountries around the world have created laws (e.g., Computer Misuse\\nAct in Britain and Singapore) and set up national agencies (e.g., the\\nComputer Analysis Response Team in the US) to combat computer\\nsecurity threats. Various technologies are applied at the national level\\nfor this purpose, such as a computer surveillance system developed by\\nthe FBI. Further, organizational measures are important in this ﬁght.Organizations need to develop and implement a multi-dimensional\\napproach to safeguard their information assets [52].\\nAmong the approaches, technological measures such as ﬁrewalls\\nfor perimeter defense are common in organizations. Such solutionsare necessary but not suf ﬁcient for protection [35]. This is because\\nsuccess of computer security depends on the effective behavior of\\nusers [43]. Employees in an organization play an essential role in the\\nprevention and detection of security incidents. While system admin-\\nistrators are responsible for con ﬁguring ﬁrewalls and servers in a\\nsecure manner, users are responsible for practicing security counter-\\nmeasures such as choosing and protecting appropriate passwords.\\nThus, for effective security, users have to make a conscious decision\\nto comply with the organization's security policies and adopt\\ncomputer security behavior. To this end, organizations have been\\nimplementing security training and awareness programs to educate\\nusers [35]. While many practitioner guidelines are available, there is a\\nlack of empirical studies concerning the design and effectiveness of\\nsecurity awareness programs. An effective awareness program should\\ninﬂuence a user's attitude and behavior to be more security-conscious\\n[47]. Thus, it is critical to understand what will in ﬂuence a user's\\nsecurity behavior so that appropriate awareness programs can be\\ndesigned. However, there is little theoretically grounded empirical\\ninformation systems research on the behavior of individuals in\\npracticing secure computing.\\nMotivated by such theoretical and practical concerns, our research\\nquestion is, “What are the salient in ﬂuences for a user to practice\\ncomputer security in an organization? ”Through this study, we aim to\\ncontribute to the better understanding of security behavior of\\ncomputer users in organizations, so that the security climate of an\\norganization can be improved. By identifying and understanding the\\ndeterminants of computer security behaviour, interventions can be\\ndesigned to change behaviour by directing at one or more of the\\ndeterminants.Decision Support Systems 46 (2009) 815 –825\\n⁎Corresponding author.\\nE-mail addresses: ngby@comp.nus.edu.sg (B.-Y.

Speci ﬁcally, it makes\\nuse of the well-known health belief model [40] traditionally employed\\nto explain preventive healthcare behavior. This perspective is\\napplicable because security practices can be seen as preventive\\nbehavior to avert security incidents. The model suggests that an\\nindividual's behavior is determined by the threat perception andevaluation of the behaviour to resolve the threat. This model offers a\\nnew perspective to better understand the phenomenon using\\nconstructs that have not been previously explored in IS research,\\nsuch as cues to action and general security orientation. Our research\\nmodel is tested by surveying 134 employees from multiple organiza-\\ntions. The ﬁndings are expected to inform theory and practice in this\\narea.\\n2. Conceptual background2.1. Computer security behavior\\nThere are relatively few research studies of security behavior of\\ncomputer users and how behavior can be modi ﬁed to practice security\\ncountermeasures. Previous studies in this area can be categorized\\naccording to their context, i.e., organizational or non-work use of\\ncomputers. An example of a study in the organizational context is the\\ninvestigation of end-user security behaviors and their antecedents by\\nStanton et al. [43]. It reveals relationships between end-user security\\nbehavior (such as password management, non-work-related comput-\\ning behavior, and obtaining security training) and a combination of\\nsituational factors (such as organizational type) and personal factors\\n(such as income level and job role). The study provides empirical\\ninsights but without theoretical bases. Yet another study in the\\norganizational context by Aytes and Connolly [4]proposes a\\nconceptual model of user security behavior based on risk perception.\\nOf the rare theoretically-grounded empirical studies in this context is\\nthe study by Chan et al. [7], which explores the in ﬂuence of security\\nclimate and self-ef ﬁcacy on user compliance to security policies. Thus\\nthere is a lack of studies that comprehensively model and test the\\nindividual beliefs that in ﬂuence computer security behavior in\\norganizations, which is broader than compliance to organizational\\nsecurity policies.\\nOther related studies pertain to computer users in a non-work\\nenvironment, which differ from organizational settings by the absenceof managerial interventions and controls. For example, the factors that\\ninﬂuence a home user's intention to practice computer security have\\nbeen investigated by applying the decomposed theory of planned\\nbehavior [33]. Findings indicate that family, peer, and mass media\\ninﬂuence, perceived usefulness, and self-ef ﬁcacy are important factors\\nthat in ﬂuence a home user's intention to practice computer security.\\nAnother empirical study in the non-work context surveyed studentsto investigate determinants of safe online behavior [29].I tﬁnds\\nsigniﬁcant in ﬂuences from online safety involvement, self-ef ﬁcacy,\\nand personal responsibility but without a theoretical explanation. In\\nanother study of college students, application of protection motivation\\ntheory borrowed from healthcare showed that self-ef ﬁcacy predicts\\nonline consumers' intention to practice safe online behavior, such as\\nupdating virus p rotection [28]. With the lack of theoretically-\\ngrounded empirical studies of determinants of computer security\\nbehavior in organizations, we now review theories that may be\\napplicable for our study.\\n2.2. Applicability of IS adoption theories\\nInformation systems (IS) research is rich in theories pertaining to\\ntechnology adoption. Computer security behavior includes the\\nadoption and use of security technologies such as anti-virus software\\nandﬁrewalls. Theories such as Technology Acceptance Model [14]and\\nTheory of Planned Behavior [3]can be applied to study users'\\nintention to use security technologies (e.g., [33]). However, recent\\nresearch in security behavior has revealed that there are signi ﬁcant\\ndifferences between positive technologies (used for designed utilities)\\nand protective technologies (used to prevent negative consequences)\\n[15]. Security technologies generally belong to the category of\\nprotective technologies as they are used to avert undesirable\\nincidents, such as virus attacks. This recent discussion gives the\\nimpetus to look for theories that are more suitable to study the use of\\nsuch protective technologies.\\nIn addition, computer security behavior involves more than just\\nthe adoption of technology. While the use of protective technologies is\\ncritical, computer security behavior also includes other behaviors such\\nas the choice of strong passwords, regular backing up of data, and\\nexercising caution with suspicious email attachments. Such behaviors\\ndo not involve the adoption of any speci ﬁc technology but require the\\ncomputer user to consciously decide to perform additional steps for\\nthe sake of preventing unwanted situations such as loss of data. For\\nFig. 1. Research model.816 B.-Y. Ng et al. / Decision Support Systems 46 (2009) 815 –825such behaviors, IS theories such as Technology Acceptance Model may\\nbe less suitable. Behavioral theories such as Theory of Planned\\nBehavior provide a general framework to study user intentions, but\\nmore could be done to explore determinants that are more speci ﬁct o\\nsecurity behavior.\\nWith the paucity of theoretical perspectives in information\\nsystems on practicing computer security, most research studieshave turned to theories in other domains. A domain that has been\\nborrowed from is healthcare. In the non-work context, security\\nbehavior of home wireless network users has been investigated\\nusing the protection motivation theory [51]. This theory has\\npreviously been used in healthca re to explain a person's coping\\nbehavior when he/she is informed of a threatening event. This and\\nother studies (e.g., [27,28] ) suggest the applicability of healthcare\\ntheories to study computer securi ty behavior. The similarities\\nbetween preventive healthcare and protective security behavior\\nare described below.\\n2.3. Relevance of healthcare behavioral theories\\nParallels can be drawn between protective security behavior (such\\nas using a strong password to prevent unauthorized use of one's\\naccount) and preventive healthcare behavior (such as observing ahealthy diet to avoid heart diseases). Preventive healthcare refers to\\nbehaviors that will prolong an individual's healthy life or practices\\nthat otherwise lessen the effects of diseases [25]. Protective security\\nbehavior refers to behaviors that will reduce the risk and/or impact of\\nsecurity incidents. There are a number of characteristics of preventive\\nhealthcare common to practicing security countermeasures. Both\\ninvolve practicing preventive and protective behavior to avert anunwanted situation. The success of preventive healthcare and security\\npractices is seen in the non-occurrence of diseases (for preventive\\nhealthcare) and security incidents (for security practices) respectively.\\nThe occurrence of diseases disrupts the normal functioning of one's\\nbody whereas the occurrence of security incidents disrupts the\\nfunctioning of one's computer system and possibly affects the\\norganization. Practicing preventive healthcare and security counter-\\nmeasures both create inconveniences for the individuals in terms of\\nextra effort.\\nMost of the theories on preventive healthcare behavior use an\\nexpectancy-value approach. Expectancy refers to beliefs about how\\nwell a person can perform a task or activity, and value refers to the\\nincentives or reasons for performing that task or activity [16].\\nAccording to the basic expectancy-value theory, a person's attitude\\ntowards a behavior is a function of the perceived likelihood of\\noutcomes associated with the behavior and the expected value or\\nTable 1\\nConstructs and items\\nConstruct Item Source\\nBehavior (BEH) BEH1: Before reading an email, I will ﬁrst check if the subject and the sender make sense.\\n(agree/disagree)[38]\\nBEH2: Before opening an email attachment, I will ﬁrst check if the ﬁlename of the\\nattachment makes sense.

The overall desirability of behavior is\\nbased on the summed products of the expectancy and value of\\noutcomes. Several well-known behavioral models have their roots in\\nexpectancy-value theories, such as social cognitive theory, protection\\nmotivation theory, and the health belief model. The next section\\ndescribes why we chose the health belief model as the lens for our\\nstudy.\\n2.4. Health belief model\\nA popular expectancy-value model used in healthcare is the health\\nbelief model. It is one of the earliest comprehensive attempts to\\nexplain healthcare behavior based on expectancy value principles\\n[40]. It has been widely applied to all types of healthcare behavior,\\nsuch as contraceptive use, diet, and exercise. It has also been applied in\\nother diverse areas, such as preventive behavior against piracy threat\\nfacing US ﬁrms[22] and emigration intention [20]. The model appears\\nto have implications for work motivations as well as a broad range of\\nhuman behaviors [49].\\nThe health belief model identi ﬁes two considerations in an\\nindividual's decision to adopt healthcare behavior in response to\\nthe threat of illness, i.e., perceptions of illness threat and\\nevaluation of behavior to resolve this threat. Perception of illness\\nthreat depends on two beliefs, i.e., the perceived susceptibility to\\nthe illness and perceived severity of the illness. Evaluation of\\nbehavior depends on assessing the perceived bene ﬁtsof thehealthcare behavior to prevent the illness and the perceived\\nbarriers to performing the preventive healthcare behavior in\\norder to compute the perceived net bene ﬁt[13].A p a r tf r o m\\nperceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived bene ﬁts and\\nperceived barriers, three other variables included in the health\\nbelief model are self-ef ﬁcacy, cues to action, and general health\\norientation. Self-ef ﬁcacy is a person's self-con ﬁdence in his ability\\nto perform a behavior. This concept originates from the social\\ncognitive theory [5]and describes individua ls' responses to the\\nchallenges of changing habitual unhealthy behaviors. Cues to\\naction are triggers that make the individual take action, such as\\nhealth education and advice from others [24].General health\\norientation refers to the individual's predisposition to healthcare\\nbehavior [49]. This construct captures the individual's tendency\\ntowards performing healthy behaviors.\\nThe health belief model is comprehensive in including a number of\\nexplanatory constructs that are not represented in IS adoption or other\\nhealthcare theories, but important in computer security practice. The\\nconstructs perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, cues to action\\nand general health orientation are not present in prior IS adoption\\ntheories, while cues to action and general health orientation are not\\npresent in other healthcare theories. One of the most important\\ncomponents of individual security behavior is the effective manage-\\nment of risk. Risk management requires the identi ﬁcation of threats\\nand determination of the likelihood and impact of threats [44]. This is\\nsimilar to the concepts of perceived susceptibility and perceived\\nseverity in the health belief model.\\nFurther, the constructs of general health orientation and cues to\\naction are likely to be relevant to computer security behavior. Cues to\\naction could include the organization's security awareness efforts.\\nGeneral health orientation is analogous to an individual's general\\norientation or predisposition to security. Applying this idea to the\\nsecurity domain, this construct is mapped to an individual's “security-\\nconsciousness ”orgeneral security orientation . To the best of our\\nknowledge, these two constructs have not been explored in past\\nsecurity behavior studies. Hence, we apply the health belief model as\\nan overarching theory to explain a user's computer security behavior\\nin an organization. In the next section, we elaborate on our research\\nmodel.\\n3. Research model\\nFig. 1 presents our research model. While most studies based on\\nthe health belief model consider behavioral intention or likelihood of\\nbehavior as the dependent variable, we use self-reported actual\\nbehavior instead. Although this variable is subject to self-report bias, it\\nis often easier to self-assess than intention and more objective. This\\napproach has been taken in a few previous empirical preventive\\nhealthcare studies (e.g., [25]) by asking respondents what behaviors\\nthey engage in. Hence, self-reported computer security behavior\\nconstitutes our dependent variable. We de ﬁne each construct and\\npresent the related hypotheses below.Table 2\\nDemographics of respondents\\nDemographic Category Percentage\\nAge 20 –29 54.6%\\n30–39 33.1%\\n40–49 10%\\nN=50 2.3%\\nGender Male 50.7%\\nFemale 49.3%\\nJob title Senior management 2.2%\\nMiddle management 15.7%\\nFirst-level supervisor 20.9%\\nTechnician 6.7%Analyst 16.4%Administrative support 17.2%Others 20.8%\\nFunctional area of job Accounting 2.2%\\nAdministration 9.7%\\nInformation Technology 47.8%\\nR&D 9.7%Operations 9.7%Marketing and Sales 8.2%Others 12.6%\\nJob tenure at current organization b1 year 3.1%\\n1–2 years 45%\\n3–5 years 25.2%\\n6–10 years 19.8%\\n11–20 years 3.8%\\nN20 years 2.3%\\nIndustry type of organization Government 19.4%\\nEducation 18.7%Finance/Banking 3.0%Information Technology 34.3%Telecommunications 6.0%\\nHealth/Medical 2.2%\\nMilitary 1.5%Others 14.9%\\nOrganization size 1 –20 6.0%\\n21–50 13.4%\\n51–100 7.5%\\n101–500 9.7%\\n501–1000 11.2%\\nN1000 52.2%Table 3\\nDescriptive statistics of constructs and inter-construct correlationsa\\nConstruct Mean SD BEH SUS SEV BEN BAR GEN CUE SEF\\nBEH 6.03 0.82 0.56\\nSUS 4.86 1.28 0.41 0.76SEV 5.42 1.05 0.33 0.36 0.64BEN 5.56 0.98 0.53 0.31 0.39 0.63BAR 3.64 1.38 −0.07 0.14 0.16 0.04 0.72\\nGEN 5.22 1.16 0.17 0.10 0.22 0.09 −0.05 0.78\\nCUE 4.96 1.44 −0.04 −0.11 0.23 0.05 0.05 0.36 0.80\\nSEF 5.22 1.14 0.40 0.08 0.05 0.11 −0.15 0.16 −0.01 0.78\\naSquare root values of average variance extracted are indicated on the diagonal cells.818 B.-Y. Ng et al. / Decision Support Systems 46 (2009) 815 –8253.1. Perceived susceptibility\\nIn the health belief model, this construct refers to the “subjective\\nrisks of contracting a condition ”[39, p. 99]. Individuals vary widely in\\ntheir perceived susceptibility. For example, an individual may deny\\nany possibility of contracting the condition, another may recognize\\nthe statistical probability, and yet another may feel that he is in realdanger of contracting the condition. Similarly, in the security domain,\\nindividuals may respond very differently even if they are presented\\nthe same facts or statistics, and this may in ﬂuence their security\\nbehaviour. Given the same information about the probability of a\\nsecurity incident, one may feel that the likelihood is high while\\nanother may feel that it will never happen. In this context, perceived\\nsusceptibility refers to a user's perceived likelihood of a security\\nincident taking place. When an individual perceives greater suscept-\\nibility to security incidents, he will be likely to exhibit a greater level of\\ncomputer security behavior. Hence, we hypothesize:\\nH1.Perceived susceptibility to security incidents is positively related\\nto computer security behavior.\\n3.2. Perceived bene ﬁts\\nIn the health belief model, perceived bene ﬁts refer to an\\nindividual's beliefs regarding the relative effectiveness of an action\\nto reduce the disease threat. It is the individual's beliefs about\\navailability and effectiveness of various courses of action, not the\\nobjective facts about the bene ﬁts, that determine a person's health\\nbehaviour [39]. Here, perceived bene ﬁts refer to a user's belief in theperceived effectiveness of practicing computer security. Thus, higher\\nperceived bene ﬁts are likely to lead to greater computer security\\nbehavior. We hypothesize:\\nH2. Perceived bene ﬁts of practicing computer security are positively\\nrelated to computer security behavior.\\n3.3. Perceived barriers\\nAlthough a person may believe that a given action is effective in\\nreducing threat, he may ﬁnd that action to be inconvenient or\\nunpleasant to him. These negative aspects are the perceived barriers\\nto action [39]. In a meta-analysis of the applications of health belief\\nmodel to preventive healthcare behaviors, perceived barriers was a\\nsigniﬁcant predictor compared to the other determinants [24]. Similar\\nto preventive healthcare behaviour, computer security behaviour\\noften causes inconvenience because of additional controls or\\nmeasures required, such as two-factor authentication instead of a\\nsimple password authentication. Here, we de ﬁne perceived barriers as\\na user's perceived cost and inconvenience of practicing computer\\nsecurity, which is likely to reduce the performance of computer\\nsecurity behavior. Hence, we hypothesize:\\nH3. Perceived barriers of practicing computer security are negatively\\nrelated to computer security behavior.\\n3.4. Cues to action\\nRosenstock [39] argues that healthcare action may not take place\\nunless “some instigating event occurred to set the process in motion ”\\n[39, p. 101]. These events are the cues to actions. Examples of cues to\\naction include internal perceptions of symptoms, impact of commu-\\nnications media, knowledge of someone suffering from a similar\\ndisease, or reminders from doctors. In our context, cues to action refer\\nto experiences or triggers that would motivate and activate a user to\\npractice computer security. Examples include exposure to security\\nawareness programs, media cues, social in ﬂuences and recommenda-\\ntions from experts. In this study, we focus on organizational efforts\\nsuch as security awareness programs as we are interested to study\\nhow employee's security behavior can be encouraged in an organiza-\\ntional context. An organization's efforts in security awareness re ﬂect\\nits management's commitment towards security and the expectations\\nit has from employees. Greater cues to action are likely to lead to\\nincreased computer security behavior. Hence, we hypothesize:\\nH4. Cues to action are positively related to computer security\\nbehavior.\\n3.5. General security orientation\\nIn the health belief model, general health orientation refers to “the\\nindividual's predisposition or habit concerning health seeking\\nbehaviour in general ”[49, p. 188]. It is not related to the anticipated\\nconsequences of healthcare behavior but is an individual's generalized\\nresponse tendency. Another study proposed a similar construct\\nnamed health consciousness ,d eﬁned as “the degree to which health\\nconcerns are integrated into a person's daily activities ”[25, p.10]. In\\nthe context of computer security, we label the construct as general\\nsecurity orientation. This refers to a user's predisposition and interest\\nconcerning practicing computer security. Individuals with higher\\nlevels of health consciousness have been observed to exhibit greater\\nlevels of preventive healthcare behaviors [25] and a similar relation-\\nship is expected between general security orientation and computer\\nsecurity behavior. Hence, we hypothesize:\\nH5. General security orientation is positively related to computer\\nsecurity behavior.Table 4\\nReliability and validity tests\\nConstruct and items Loading t-value Cronbach alpha\\nBEH 0.65\\nBEH1 0.49 ⁎⁎⁎ 5.31\\nBEH2 0.53 ⁎⁎⁎ 5.77\\nBEH3 0.53 ⁎⁎⁎ 5.79\\nBEH4 0.67 ⁎⁎⁎ 7.49\\nSUS 0.78\\nSUS1 0.60 ⁎⁎⁎ 6.96\\nSUS2 0.89 ⁎⁎⁎ 11.05\\nSUS3 0.75 ⁎⁎⁎ 9.07\\nSEV 0.67\\nSEV1 0.72 ⁎⁎⁎ 7.76\\nSEV2 0.58 ⁎⁎⁎ 6.16\\nSEV3 0.61 ⁎⁎⁎ 6.48\\nBEN 0.65\\nBEN1 0.56 ⁎⁎⁎ 6.09\\nBEN2 0.68 ⁎⁎⁎ 7.62\\nBEN3 0.62 ⁎⁎⁎ 6.81\\nBAR 0.80\\nBAR1 0.60 ⁎⁎⁎ 7.13\\nBAR2 0.90 ⁎⁎⁎ 11.59\\nBAR3 0.66 ⁎⁎⁎ 7.89\\nBAR4 0.68 ⁎⁎⁎ 8.29\\nGEN 0.85\\nGEN1 0.71 ⁎⁎⁎ 9.07\\nGEN2 0.85 ⁎⁎⁎ 11.60\\nGEN3 0.65 ⁎⁎⁎ 8.04\\nGEN4 0.87 ⁎⁎⁎ 11.94\\nCUE 0.87\\nCUE1 0.87 ⁎⁎⁎ 12.18\\nCUE2 0.70 ⁎⁎⁎ 8.92\\nCUE3 0.79 ⁎⁎⁎ 10.45\\nCUE4 0.83 ⁎⁎⁎ 11.34\\nSEF 0.86\\nSEF1 0.61 ⁎⁎⁎ 7.35\\nSEF2 0.82 ⁎⁎⁎ 11.06\\nSEF3 0.86 ⁎⁎⁎ 11.76\\nSEF4 0.83 ⁎⁎⁎ 11.12\\n⁎⁎⁎pb0.001.819 B.-Y. Ng et al. / Decision Support Systems 46 (2009) 815 –8253.6. Self-ef ﬁcacy\\nSelf-ef ﬁcacy is another antecedent in the health belief model [41]\\nand a useful predictor of healthcare behavior [1]. The roots of self-\\nefﬁcacy come from social cognitive theory and it refers to an\\nindividual's self-con ﬁdence in his ability to perform a behavior [5].\\nAccording to social cognitive theory, individuals with greater\\nconﬁdence in their abilities are more likely to initiate challenging\\nbehaviors such as smoking cessation [37]. Self-ef ﬁcacy, when applied\\nin the area of computer training, was found to exert a strong in ﬂuence\\non individuals' performance in a computer training course [11]. In this\\nstudy, self-ef ﬁcacy refers to a user's self-con ﬁdence in his/her skills or\\nability in practicing computer security, which is likely to increase\\ncomputer security behavior. This leads us to our next hypothesis:\\nH6. Self-ef ﬁcacy is positively related to computer security behavior.\\n3.7. Perceived severity\\nIn the health belief model, this construct refers to a person's\\nconviction concerning the seriousness of a given health problem.\\nPerceived seriousness is not limited to the clinical consequence of a\\nhealth problem, but may extend to the implications on the individual's\\njob or family [39]. Similarly, in computer security, a person's perceived\\nseriousness of a security incident is not limited to the damage to\\nsystems and data, but also the implications on the person's job or\\norganization. This is particularly so in the organizational context as\\nthe data that is affected by a security incident is likely to be owned by\\nthe organization. Loss of con ﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability of\\norganizational data may affect the organization negatively and disrupt\\nemployees' work. An employee who did not practice computer\\nsecurity, thus resulting in security incidents, may also be held\\nresponsible by the organization. Though the consequences of a\\nsecurity incident may be severe, individual employees may have a\\ndifferent perception of the severity or extent of the damage. We de ﬁne\\nperceived severity to be a user's perceived seriousness of a security\\nincident, which should lead to greater computer security behavior. We\\nhypothesize:\\nH7.Perceived severity of security incidents is positively related to\\ncomputer security behavior.Of all the above determinants, we believe perceived severity\\nmoderates the effects of the other determinants. This is based on the\\nroots of the Health Belief Model, i.e., the basic expectancy-value\\ntheory that the desirability of behavior is based on the summed\\nproducts of the expectancy and value of outcomes. Perceived severity\\ncan be regarded as valence or value in Vroom's [48] expectancy theory\\nfor motivation. Vroom de ﬁnes motivation as an interaction between\\nexpectancy and value, which refers to the valence to the individual of\\nthe outcomes. The main objective of practicing computer security is to\\navert negative consequences, and hence the valence of the behavior is\\nthe perceived severity or consequences of negative outcomes.Perceived severity is a weighting factor in in ﬂuencing other variables'\\neffects on computer security behavior.\\nA study using Health Belief Model to predict health behaviors in\\ncollege students hypothesized that perceived threat (the combination\\nof perceived severity and perceived susceptibility) affects health\\nbehavior [2]. A meta-analytic review of the protection motivation\\ntheory suggests that perceived severity of the disease may in ﬂuence\\nthe role of perceived vulnerability, which is the same as perceived\\nsusceptibility in the Health Belief Model [30]. As risk is based on the\\nlikelihood of threat (similar to susceptibility) multiplied by the impact\\nof threat (similar to severity) [44], we hypothesize that perceived\\nseverity magni ﬁes the effect of perceived susceptibility:\\nH7a. Perceived severity increases the positive effect of perceived\\nsusceptibility on computer security behavior.\\nAdditionally, we hypothesize that perceived severity reduces the\\neffects of perceived bene ﬁts and perceived barriers. In the face of a severe\\nthreat, the effects of perceived bene ﬁts and perceived barriers become less\\nimportant. If a person believes that the negative consequences are\\nsigniﬁcantly severe, he is likely to practice the countermeasures even if he\\nthinks that the countermeasures may not be fully effective because some\\nprotection is better than no protection. Similarly, when consequences are\\nsevere, it will outweigh the cost of any inconvenience in practicing the\\ncountermeasures. This leads us to the next two hypotheses:\\nH7b. Perceived severity reduces the positive effect of perceived\\nbeneﬁts on computer security behavior.\\nH7c. Perceived severity reduces the negative effect of perceived\\nbarriers on computer security behavior.Table 5\\nRegression models\\nModel Model 1 Model 2 Model 3\\nMain effects Interaction effects Full\\nVariables Coef ﬁcient Coef ﬁcient Coef ﬁcient t-value Results\\nPerceived susceptibility 0.22 ⁎⁎ 0.21 ⁎⁎ 0.23 ⁎⁎ 3.48 H1 supported\\nPerceived Bene ﬁts 0.39 ⁎⁎⁎ 0.39 ⁎⁎⁎ 0.39 ⁎⁎⁎ 5.58 H2 supported\\nPerceived Barriers −0.08 −0.09 −0.08 −1.24 H3 not supported\\nCues to Action −0.08 −0.06 −0.10 −1.49 H4 not supported\\nGeneral Security Orientation 0.07 0.12 0.11 1.46 H5 not supportedSelf-ef ﬁcacy 0.31 ⁎⁎⁎ 0.35 ⁎⁎⁎ 0.33 ⁎⁎⁎ 5.02 H6 supported\\nPerceived Severity 0.10 0.11 0.09 1.10 H7 not supported\\nPerceived Severity×perceived susceptibility 0.06 0.06 0.88 H7a not supportedPerceived Severity×Perceived Bene ﬁts −0.17⁎ −0.16⁎ −2.16 H7b supported\\nPerceived Severity×Perceived Barriers 0.11 0.10 1.58 H7c not supportedPerceived Severity×Cues to Action 0.17 ⁎⁎ 0.18⁎⁎ 2.86 H7d supported\\nPerceived Severity×General Security Orientation 0.17 ⁎⁎ 0.19⁎⁎ 2.78 H7e supported\\nPerceived Severity×self-ef ﬁcacy −0.19⁎⁎ −0.18⁎⁎ −2.88 H7f supported\\nTechnical controls (control variable) 0.13 1.77\\nSecurity familiarity (control variable) 0.00 0.06\\nDummy variable for student 0.02 0.26\\nR\\n20.479 0.593 0.605\\nChange in R20.114 0.012\\nAdjusted R20.450 0.549 0.551\\n*pb0.05, ** pb0.01, *** pb0.001.820 B.-Y. Ng et al. / Decision Support Systems 46 (2009) 815 –825When a person perceives a threat to be severe, cues to action are\\neven more likely to trigger him into action. In other words, perceived\\nseverity and cues to action are likely to have a synergistic effect on\\ncomputer security behavior. Similarly, a person who is highly\\nconscious of security is even more likely to act if he perceives the\\nthreat to be severe. The higher consciousness may make the individual\\nmore proactive in computer security behavior when the perceivedseverity of threat is higher. Hence, we hypothesize:\\nH7d. Perceived severity increases the positive effect of cues to action\\non computer security behavior.\\nH7e. Perceived severity increases the positive effect of general\\nsecurity orientation on computer security behavior.\\nFinally, we hypothesize that perceived severity reduces the effect\\nof self-ef ﬁcacy. If a person perceives the threat to be severe, he is more\\nlikely to attempt practicing the countermeasure even if he is not fully\\nconﬁdent of his ability to do so, as the negative consequences of the\\nthreat drives him into action. This leads us to our last hypothesis:\\nH7f. Perceived severity reduces the positive effect of self-ef ﬁcacy on\\ncomputer security behavior.\\nIn addition to the above constructs, we measure the organization's\\ntechnical controls as a control variable. Past literature has suggested\\nthat the presence of technical controls may lead to users having less\\nconcern for security as they may perceive that adequate security\\ncontrols are in place [46]. Another control variable is the familiarity\\nwith computer security practices. This acts as a control for the\\nindividual's prior knowledge and skills in computer security. Hence,\\nthese two variables are added as control variables to rule out possible\\nrival explanations and improve the internal validity of this study [45].\\n4. Research methodology\\nThe model was quantitatively tested using the survey methodol-\\nogy[32]. The survey instrument was developed following procedures\\nrecommended by Churchill [9]. The ﬁrst step was to specify the\\ndomain of the construct. The second step was to generate items thatcapture the domain as speci ﬁed. The constructs were operationalized\\nby adapting items from past literature whenever possible. After\\nconsidering the original de ﬁnitions of the constructs in the health\\nbelief model, we referred to academic and industry security literature\\nand adapted the constructs for the security behavior domain. Pre-tests\\nof the items were conducted with experts in the ﬁeld. Finally, sorting\\nprocedures for the conceptual validation of the instrument [31] were\\nconducted.\\n4.1. Operationalization\\nMany of the studies applying the health belief model till now have\\nbeen characterized by poor operationalization of constructs and\\nfailure to assess construct validity and reliability. In particular, some\\nstudies suffered from problems of multi-dimensionality in operatio-\\nnalizing the model (e.g., [1]). Hence, care was exercised when\\nborrowing items from past studies to ensure rigor in our methodology.\\nChallenges were also faced in adapting these constructs to the\\ncontext of computer security. One of these challenges was in measuring\\ncomputer security behavior. Safe computing behavior involves a wide\\nrange of speci ﬁc behaviors, which if combined in one variable will pose\\nmultidimensionality problems. Hence, we measure one common\\npractice as a representation of security behavior, i.e., exercising care\\nwhen reading emails with attachments . Organizations generally permit\\nmembers to have email access. It is thus important to be careful when\\nreading emails, as virus attacks are one of the most reported causes of\\nﬁnancial loss [18] and typically spread through email. Even though\\ncomputers may be running anti-virus software, new viruses may not be\\ndetected by the software. Suspicious emails, such as those from\\nunknown sources or with unsolicited attachments, should not be read\\n[38]. Thus, items for this construct measure if users check for suspicious\\nemail headers, attachment ﬁlenames, or email content before opening\\nan attachment. We also added an overall item that measures whether a\\nuser exercises caution when he/she receives an email attachment.\\n4.2. Conceptual validation of instrument\\nInstrument validation consists of assessing content, conceptual,\\nand construct validity, and reliability [45]. Content validity is ensured\\nFig. 2. Graphical display of results. ( ⁎pb0.05, ⁎⁎pb0.01, ⁎⁎⁎pb0.001).821 B.-Y. Ng et al. / Decision Support Systems 46 (2009) 815 –825by drawing representative questions from a universal pool. Hence,\\nitems were generated by drawing from past literature in security\\nbehavior and adapting items from literature in healthcare behavior. In\\naddition, pre-tests of the items were conducted by interviewing\\nacademic as well as industry experts in this ﬁeld. Items were\\ndeveloped and re ﬁned based on the comments gathered from the\\npre-tests.\\nConceptual validity can be assessed by using the sorting proce-\\ndures proposed by Moore and Benbasat [31]. Here, we describe the\\nprocess and results of the sorting procedures. In the ﬁrst round of\\nsorting (unlabelled), four judges sorted items into self-created\\ncategories as they were not told what the underlying constructs\\nwere. The level of agreement between judges was measured using\\nCohen's Kappa. A second measure of validity is the overall placement\\nratio of items placed within the target construct [31]. This round was\\nrepeated with a different set of judges after some items were re ﬁned\\nto improve the clarity. For the third round (labeled), another four\\njudges were recruited and given the labels and de ﬁnitions of the\\nconstructs before the sort. Kappa scores averaged 0.83 while the\\noverall placement ratio of items within target constructs was 93%.\\nThus, we conclude that the instrument development process resulted\\nin scales that demonstrated high conceptual validity. Table 1 shows\\ntheﬁnal list of items. All items are anchored on 7-point Likert scales.\\n4.3. Survey administration\\nFollowing the development of the instrument, the survey ques-\\ntionnaire was prepared. To reduce measurement error, care was taken\\nin preparing the questionnaire layout, the question format, and the\\nquestion order [32]. The questionnaire was designed to be clear and\\nneat. Color paper was used to give a professional appearance. Detailed\\ninstructions with examples were provided. Identifying information\\n(the name of the university conducting the research) was prominently\\ndisplayed on the questionnaire for credibility enhancement.\\nNumeric labels were used for each item, but verbal labels were\\nprovided in the examples found in the instructions to help all\\nrespondents interpret the scales consistently and to produce more\\nreliable measurement [42]. Questions were organized into sections to\\nminimize confusion of respondents and an introductory statement\\nabout the section was provided to orient the respondents [32].\\nRespondents were also informed that this survey pertains to their use\\nof email in their respective organizations; this helped the respondents\\nto interpret the questions in the intended organizational context. To\\nreduce errors arising from common method bias, the presentation\\norder of items was shuf ﬂed within the section.\\nThe survey was administered to part-time (working) students in\\ntwo computing classes at a large public university and individuals\\nemployed in three IT-related organizations to which we had access,\\nproviding a sample of 134 employees. The response rate approximated\\n31%. The questions were administered in paper form at the end of class\\nor at the of ﬁce location where the respondents worked. The responses\\nwere returned back to the researchers directly after completion\\nwithout any intermediaries. A small token incentive was given to\\nrespondents who completed the survey to encourage response. All\\nquestionnaires were checked to make sure responses were complete.\\nTable 2 summarizes the demographics of the sample and the\\ncharacteristics of the organizations represented by the survey\\nrespondents. Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics for all constructs\\nand the inter-construct correlations.\\n5. Data analysis\\nMultiple regression analysis is a ﬂexible and adaptable multi-\\nvariate technique that can be used to examine the relationship\\nbetween a single dependent variable and a set of independent\\nvariables [21]. It is also the recommended approach for testinginteractions with continuous variables [10]. Hence, we used moder-\\nated multiple regression to test our model with interaction hypoth-\\neses [23].W e ﬁrst established the reliability and construct validity of\\nour instrument before we proceeded to test the hypotheses using\\nregression. The assumptions of regression were also tested.\\n5.1. Construct validity and reliability\\nWith multiple indicators measuring each construct, construct\\nvalidity is important to ensure that the various indicators operate in\\nthe intended manner. Reliability refers to dependability, which means\\nthat the results produced by indicators are consistent and do not vary\\nbecause of the measurement process [32]. Cronbach Alpha reliability\\ncoefﬁcient was used to test the reliability of the items. For internal\\nconsistency, Cronbach Alpha should have a value of at least 0.707 [34].\\nHowever, for exploratory studies, such as ours, a minimum alpha value\\nof 0.6 is allowable [34].Table 4 summarizes the factor loadings (for\\nconstruct validity) and reliability test results. Although one item\\n(BEH1) demonstrates factor loadings less than 0.5 which is the\\nrecommended threshold [21], dropping this item decreases the\\nCronbach Alpha. Since its loading is signi ﬁcant at 0.001 level, this\\nitem is retained. Since all constructs exhibited acceptable construct\\nvalidity and reliability, we proceeded to test the hypotheses.\\n5.2. Hypotheses testing\\nTable 5 shows the regression models that we ran. As per\\nmoderated multiple regression procedures, the ﬁrst model tested\\nthe main effects, the second model included the interaction terms, and\\nthe third (full) model included the control variables as well. Table 5\\nand Fig. 2 show the results of hypotheses testing using moderated\\nmultiple regression techniques. Examination of the tolerance values\\nand the variance in ﬂation factors indicated that multicollinearity was\\nnot a problem [21]. When adding the control variables (technical\\ncontrols of the organization and the individual's familiarity with\\ncomputer security practices), no signi ﬁcant change was observed in\\nthe model. We also added a dummy variable to indicate whether the\\nrespondents were part-time (working) students or non-student\\nemployees. The control variables and the dummy variable were not\\nsigniﬁcant. The explanatory power ( R2) for the model with main and\\nmoderating effects was 0.59, which is well above the acceptable\\nthreshold of 10% [17]. The two control variables and the dummy\\nvariable explained an additional variance of 1% in the dependent\\nvariable. The results indicated that perceived susceptibility, perceived\\nbeneﬁts, and self-ef ﬁcacy were signi ﬁcant in determining individuals'\\ncomputer security behavior, i.e., H1, H2, and H6 were supported.\\nHowever, perceived barriers, cues to action, general security orienta-\\ntion, and perceived severity were not signi ﬁcant determinants of\\nindividuals' computer security behavior, i.e., H3, H4, H5, and H7 were\\nnot supported. Furthermore, perceived severity moderated the effects\\nof perceived bene ﬁts, cues to action, general security orientation, and\\nself-ef ﬁcacy, i.e., H7b, H7d, H7e and H7f were supported. The\\nmoderating effects of perceived severity on perceived susceptibility\\nand perceived barriers were not signi ﬁcant, i.e., H7a and H7c were not\\nsupported. In total, 7 out of 13 hypotheses were supported.\\n6. Discussion6.1. Discussion of results\\nThe results of the study show that perceived susceptibility,\\nperceived bene ﬁts, and self-ef ﬁcacy are determinants of a user's\\ncomputer security behavior, when applied to exercising care with\\nemail attachments. The ﬁrst two results are consistent with the nature\\nof security as the motivation for security is to mitigate risks and\\nreduce threat likelihood [44]. Self-ef ﬁcacy is also important, as a822 B.-Y. Ng et al. / Decision Support Systems 46 (2009) 815 –825computer user must be con ﬁdent and able to perform the necessary\\nmitigation measures. In fact, a meta-analysis of the prediction of\\nhealth behavior shows that self-ef ﬁcacy, of all variables, was most\\nstrongly related to intention and behavior [30]. This study highlights\\nthe importance of self-ef ﬁcacy as well.\\nOurﬁndings show that the main effects of perceived barriers, cues\\nto action, general security orientation, and perceived severity are notsigniﬁcant. Security is usually viewed as an inconvenience, which may\\ndeter users from practicing safe behavior. However, for this particular\\nstudy, the mean of the perceived barriers construct is lower than the\\nother constructs (refer to Table 3 ), indicating that users did not ﬁnd\\nmuch barriers or inconvenience in practicing safe email behavior. Since\\nthe survey respondents were quite IT-savvy, as they were part-time\\n(working) computing students and/or work in IT-related organiza-\\ntions, they might not ﬁnd it dif ﬁcult to practice secure email behavior.\\nOurﬁndings indicate that cues to action, in particular organiza-\\ntional efforts such as awareness programs, are not signi ﬁcant in\\ntriggering a person to behave in a secure manner. This does not rule\\nout other forms of cues to action, such as individual experience or\\nother forms of communications external to the organization, which\\nare not measured in this study. The results also indicate that a person's\\ngeneral security orientation is not signi ﬁcant in determining security\\nbehavior. However, these effects are signi ﬁcant when moderated by\\nperceived severity.\\nOurﬁndings indicate that perceived severity is not a signi ﬁcant\\ndeterminant of security behavior. This is not a surprising ﬁnding as\\nsome of the past studies in health behavior have shown perceived\\nseverity to be a weak direct predictor of health behavior [30].\\nAlthough the main effect of perceived severity is not signi ﬁcant, it\\nmagni ﬁes the effects of cues to action and general security orientation.\\nThis indicates contingency effects, that is, the effects of these factors\\nalone may not be effective in pushing one to practice security, but the\\ncombination of these factors may lead to computer security behavior.\\nPerceived severity is not signi ﬁcant on its own, but operates with\\nmultiple other factors to in ﬂuence computer security behavior.\\nAs hypothesized, perceived severity reduces the effect of perceived\\nbeneﬁts and self-ef ﬁcacy. This implies that when perceived severity is\\nhigh, perceived bene ﬁts and self-ef ﬁcacy are not as important in\\ndetermining one's decision to practice security. Although perceived\\nseverity does not have a signi ﬁcant main effect, the above moderating\\neffects highlight the importance of perceived severity, that it indeed\\nhas a signi ﬁcant role in in ﬂuencing computer security behavior, albeit\\nin conjunction with other conditions.\\nOur\\nﬁndings also indicate that the interaction of perceived severity\\nand perceived susceptibility is not signi ﬁcant. This means that\\nperceived susceptibility has a signi ﬁcant main effect on computer\\nsecurity behavior that is not moderated by perceived severity. It is a\\ndirect determinant that operates on its own. The interaction effect of\\nperceived severity and perceived barriers is also not signi ﬁcant. As\\ndiscussed earlier, this may be because our respondents did not ﬁnd\\nmuch inconvenience or barriers in practicing email security.\\n6.2. Limitations and future work\\nIn this study, one security practice was measured, thus limiting the\\ngeneralizability of the results to other computer security practices,\\nsuch as applying system patches or using a strong password. Future\\nstudies on other computer security practices could help to uncover the\\ncommon causal relationships for these computer security practices.\\nAnother limitation is the sample size. Future research could replicate\\nthis study using a larger sample size. It would also be useful to compare\\nresults obtained from survey respondents who are not as IT-savvy. The\\ndeterminants of security behavior of such a population may differ.\\nCues to action and general security orientation are new concepts\\nthat are not previously explored in IS or security behavioral research.\\nFurther work is required to explore these concepts. For example, ourstudy measures a subset of possible cues to action. There may be other\\ncues to action, which are signi ﬁcant in motivating a person to adopt\\nsecurity practices. The contingency of these factors is novel and can be\\nfurther explored with different security practices or with different\\norganizational contexts.\\n7. Implications and conclusion7.1. Theoretical implications\\nFor academics, this study reduces the gap in our understanding of\\nuser computer security behavior in the context of the organization.\\nThough there are plenty of practical guidelines on improving user\\nbehavior suggested by practitioners, their effectiveness has not been\\ninvestigated. This study helps to address the lack of theoretically-based\\nand empirically validated research in this area. This study assesses the\\nsuitability of using a theory from the health domain to explain computer\\nsecurity behavior. Considerable success is achieved giving impetus for\\nfuture research studies in this area. In particular, the constructs cues to\\naction and general security orientation are new in this area of research.\\nTo our best knowledge, no other study has explored the in ﬂuence of\\nthese constructs in security behavior. The constructs perceived\\nsusceptibility and perceived severity are also relatively new in IS\\nresearch. Similar constructs are used in one study [51].\\nFurthermore, the moderating effects of perceived severity are an\\nimportant discovery and contribution through the application of the\\nhealth belief model in the context of computer security. This sheds\\nlight on the determinants of computer security behavior and the\\nconditions in which they operate, i.e., that the effects are only\\nsigniﬁcant in the presence of speci ﬁc conditions. This study has\\noperationalized and extended the popular health belief model to a\\nnew area of research. In this way, it has deepened our understanding\\nof human behavior in the face of threats, be it health or security\\nthreats. We have also developed and validated items that can be used\\nto measure the constructs of the health belief model applied in the\\ncomputer security context.\\n7.2. Practical implications\\nThere are also implications for practitioners in the ﬁeld of\\ninformation security awareness program design based on this study.\\nThe importance of perceived severity (as a moderator), perceived\\nsusceptibility and perceived bene ﬁts instructs us on how to design the\\ncontent for organizational security awareness messages. Indeed,\\nsecurity awareness messages from security-related organizations\\ntend to focus on the susceptibility and severity of consequences and\\ntherefore the importance of practicing security. In a content analysis of\\nnine online safety websites (e.g. US-Cert and ISAFE websites), content\\nrelated to perceived severity and perceived susceptibility are found in\\nall nine websites [27]. When users are aware of the likelihood of\\nthreats (perceived susceptibility) and the effectiveness of security\\ncontrols (perceived bene ﬁts), they can make a conscious decision to\\nperform the appropriate preventive behavior. Security awareness\\nprograms should focus on educating users about the possibility and\\ndamage of security threats and incidents so that users understand the\\nneed for security and their roles and responsibilities in protecting\\norganizational data and other information assets. In particular,\\nsecurity awareness messages can be carefully designed to highlight\\nseverity and susceptibility. For example, using personalized language\\nsuch as “You face a 50% chance of being infected by a computer virus ”\\ncan increase perceived susceptibility [50].\\nIn addition, security awareness programs should train users on the\\npurpose and functions of security controls, be it technical, physical, or\\nhuman controls. This helps users to understand the bene ﬁts of\\ncontrols and how they mitigate the risk of security threats. The\\nimportance of self-ef ﬁcacy indicates the need for security training so823 B.-Y. Ng et al. / Decision Support Systems 46 (2009) 815 –825that users are equipped with the con ﬁdence in their skills to practice\\nthe appropriate security behavior. Security messages should thus be\\ndesigned to make employees believe that they are able to perform the\\nrecommended security behavior [50].\\nDespite the importance of security awareness and training, our\\nresults show that organizational security awareness programs and\\nactivities (measured in the construct cues to action) may not be attainingtheir desired effectiveness. Hence, there is a need to re-look at the design\\nand implementation of security awareness campaigns so that users are\\neffectively educated on threat information and skills to mitigate security\\nthreats, thereby improving the security climate of the organization. A\\ncustomized approach may be needed so that security awareness\\nmessages are targeted at individuals with appropriate content and at a\\nsuitable level and frequency. Organizations should also consider other\\nmeans of bringing security messages across to employees, besides using\\nsecurity awareness programs. Deterrence and enforcement measures\\nmay complement security awareness activities to improve users'\\ncomputer security behavior. The interaction effect between cues to\\naction and perceived severity also sheds some light on how to design\\neffective security awareness programs. The severe consequences for\\nsecurity incidents and the implications to self and organization should\\nbe emphasized in security awareness messages so that employees\\nunderstand the severity and the message also acts as a trigger that\\nprompts employees to practice computer security. For example, security\\nmessages sent out to employees to patch their systems may be even\\nmore effective if the message explains the severity and consequences if\\nthe systems are not patched promptly. Emphasizing the severity of\\nsecurity incidents will also motivate employees who are more security-\\nconscious to practice computer security, as suggested by the interaction\\neffect between perceived severity and general security orientation.\\nInformation security of an organization cannot be neglected, and it\\nis clear that technology solutions alone are not suf ﬁcient. The security\\nbehavior of employees play an important role, and this calls for more\\nresearch studying the factors that in ﬂuence individual's decision to\\npractice computer security. This study has uncovered factors that\\ninﬂuence safe email behavior through the application of the health\\nbelief model. This can help organizations to improve the design of\\ntheir security awareness program. More can be learnt from the health\\ndomain as management attempts to spread the message that every-\\none has a role to play in information security.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis research is supported by the research grant number R-253-\\n000-033-112, School of Computing, National University of Singapore.\\nWe thank the editor and the reviewers for their comments and\\nsuggestions.\\nReferences\\n[1] C.

INTRODUCTION\\nNeural networks, or more precisely artiÞcial neural\\nnetworks, are a branch of artiÞcial intelligence. Multi-layer perceptrons form one type of neural network asillustrated in the taxonomy in Fig. 1. This article onlyconsiders the multilayer perceptron since a growingnumber of articles are appearing in the atmospheric\\nliterature that cite its use. Many of these papers de-\\nscribe the beneÞts that neural networks o¤er whencompared to more traditional statistical modellingtechniques. Most of the papers brießy describe theworkings of neural networks and provide references,to books and papers, from which the reader may\\nobtain further information. This review is aimed at\\nreaders with little or no understanding of neural net-works and is designed to act as a guide through theliterature so that they may better appreciate this tool.\\nThis review is divided into several sections, begin-\\nning with a brief introduction to the multilayer percep-\\ntron followed by a description of the most basic\\nalgorithm for training a multilayer perceptron, knownas backpropagation. A review of some of the recentapplications of the multilayer perceptron to atmo-spheric problems will be presented followed by a dis-cussion of some of the common practical problems and\\nlimitations associated with a neural network approach.\\n2. THE MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON:\\nA BRIEF INTRODUCTION\\nEnvironmental modelling involves using a variety\\nof approaches, possibly in combination. Choosing the\\n*Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.most suitable approach depends on the complexity of\\nthe problem being addressed and the degree to whichthe problem is understood. Assuming adequate data\\nand computing resources and if a strong theoretical\\nunderstanding of the problem is available then a fullnumerical model is perhaps the most desirable solu-tion. However, in general, as the complexity of a prob-lem increases the theoretical understanding decreases(due to ill-deÞned interactions between systems) and\\nstatistical approaches are required. Recently, the use\\nof neural networks, and in particular the multilayerperceptron, have been shown to be e¤ective alterna-tives to more traditional statistical techniques(Schalko¤, 1992). Primarily it has been shown(Hornik et al., 1989) that the multilayer perceptron\\ncan be trained to approximate virtually any smooth,\\nmeasurable function. Unlike other statistical tech-niques the multilayer perceptron makes no prior as-sumptions concerning the data distribution. It canmodel highly non-linear functions and can be trainedto accurately generalise when presented with new,\\nunseen data. These features of the multilayer percep-\\ntron make it an attractive alternative to developingnumerical models, and also when choosing betweenstatistical approaches. As will be seen the multilayerperceptron has many applications in the atmosphericsciences.\\nThe multilayer perceptron consists of a system of\\nsimple interconnected neurons, or nodes, as illus-trated in Fig. 2, which is a model representing anonlinear mapping between an input vector and anoutput vector. The nodes are connected by weightsand output signals which are a function of the sum of\\nthe inputs to the node modiÞed by a simple nonlinear\\ntransfer, or activation, function. It is the superposi-tion of many simple nonlinear transfer functions that\\n2627Fig. 1. A taxonomy of neural network architectures (after Jain et al., 1996).\\nFig. 3. The logistic function y\"1/(1!exp(!x)).\\nFig. 2. A multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers.enables the multilayer perceptron to approximate ex-\\ntremely non-linear functions. If the transfer functionwas linear then the multilayer perceptron would onlybe able to model linear functions. Due to its easilycomputed derivative a commonly used transfer func-\\ntion is the logistic function, as shown in Fig. 3. The\\noutput of a node is scaled by the connecting weightand fed forward to be an input to the nodes in the nextlayer of the network. This implies a direction of in-formation processing, hence the multilayer perceptronis known as a feed-forward neural network. The archi-\\ntecture of a multilayer perceptron is variable but in\\ngeneral will consist of several layers of neurons. Theinput layer plays no computational role but merelyserves to pass the input vector to the network. Theterms input and output vectors refer to the inputs andoutputs of the multilayer perceptron and can be repre-\\nsented as single vectors, as shown in Fig. 2. A multi-\\nlayer perceptron may have one or more hidden layersand Þnally an output layer. Multilayer perceptrons2628 M. W. GARDNER and S. R. DORLINGare described as being fully connected, with each node\\nconnected to every node in the next and previouslayer.\\nBy selecting a suitable set of connecting weights and\\ntransfer functions, it has been shown that a multilayerperceptron can approximate any smooth, measurablefunction between the input and output vectors(Hornik et al., 1989). Multilayer perceptrons have the\\nability to learn through training. Training requires\\na set of training data, which consists of a series of\\ninput and associated output vectors. During trainingthe multilayer perceptron is repeatedly presented withthe training data and the weights in the network areadjusted until the desired input Ðoutput mapping\\noccurs. Multilayer perceptrons learn in a supervised\\nmanner. During training the output from the multi-\\nlayer perceptron, for a given input vector, may notequal the desired output. An error signal is deÞned asthe di¤erence between the desired and actual output.Training uses the magnitude of this error signal todetermine to what degree the weights in the network\\nshould be adjusted so that the overall error of the\\nmultilayer perceptron is reduced. There are manyalgorithms that can be used to train a multilayerperceptron. Once trained with suitably representativetraining data (see Section 6) the multilayer perceptroncan generalise to new, unseen input data.\\n3. TRAINING A MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON ÐTHE BACK-\\nPROPAGATION ALGORITHM\\nTraining a multilayer perceptron is the procedure\\nby which the values for the individual weights are\\ndetermined such that the relationship the network ismodelling is accurately resolved. At this point we willconsider a simple multilayer perceptron that containsonly two weights. For any combination of weights thenetwork error for a given pattern can be deÞned. By\\nvarying the weights through all possible values, and\\nby plotting the errors in three-dimensional space, weend up with a plot like the one shown in Fig. 4. Sucha surface is known as an error surface. The objectiveof training is to Þnd the combination of weights whichresult in the smallest error. In practice, it is not pos-\\nsible to plot such a surface due to the multitude of\\nweights. What is required is a method to Þnd theminimum point of the error surface.\\nOne possible technique is to use a procedure known\\nas gradient descent. The backpropagation trainingalgorithm uses this procedure to attempt to locate the\\nabsolute (or global) minimum of the error surface. The\\nbackpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986) is\\nthe most computationally straightforward algorithmfor training the multilayer perceptron. Backpropaga-tion has been shown to perform adequately in manyapplications; the majority of the applications dis-\\ncussed in this paper used backpropagation to train\\nthe multilayer perceptrons. A full mathematical deri-vation of this algorithm can be found in almost all\\nFig. 4. An error surface for a simple multilayer perceptron\\ncontaining only two weights.\\nneural network textbooks (e.g. Bishop 1995) so only\\nthe essential components of the algorithm will be\\ndiscussed here. Backpropagation only refers to thetraining algorithm and is not another term for themultilayer perceptron or feed-forward neural net-works, as is commonly reported.\\nThe weights in the network are initially set to small\\nrandom values. This is synonymous with selecting\\na random point on the error surface. The backpropa-gation algorithm then calculates the local gradient ofthe error surface and changes the weights in the direc-tion of steepest local gradient. Given a reasonablysmooth error surface, it is hoped that the weights will\\nconverge to the global minimum of the error surface.\\nThe backpropagation algorithm is summarised be-\\nlow. Implementation details can be found in mostneural network books (e.g. Bishop, 1995).\\n1. initialise network weights,\\n2. present Þrst input vector, from training data, to\\nthe network,\\n3. propagate the input vector through the network\\nto obtain an output,\\n4. calculate an error signal by comparing actual\\noutput to the desired (target) output,\\n5. propagate error signal back through the net-\\nwork,\\n6. adjust weights to minimise overall error,\\n7. repeat steps 2 Ð7 with next input vector, until\\noverall error is satisfactorily small.\\nThe above implementation of the backpropagation\\nalgorithm is known as on-line training whereby the\\nnetwork weights are adapted after each pattern has\\nbeen presented. The alternative is known as batchtraining, where the summed error for all patterns isused to update the weights. The beneÞts of each ap-proach are discussed in Battiti (1992). In practice,many thousands of training iterations will be required\\nbefore the network error reaches a satisfactory\\nlevelÐdetermined by the problem being addressed.As will be discussed later, training should be stoppedApplications in the atmospheric sciences 2629when the performance of the multilayer perceptron\\non independent test data reaches a maximum,which is not necessarily when the network error is\\nminimised.\\nThe error surface in Fig. 4 contains more than\\none minimum. It is desirable that the trainingalgorithm does not become trapped in a local min-imum. The backpropagation algorithm contains twoadjustable parameters, a learning rate and a mo-\\nmentum term, which can assist the training process in\\navoiding this. The learning rate determines the stepsize taken during the iterative gradient descent learn-ing process. If this is too large then the network errorwill change erratically due to large weight changes,with the possibility of jumping over the global min-\\nima. Conversely, if the learning rate is too small then\\ntraining will take a long time. The momentum term isused to assist the gradient descent process if it be-comes stuck in a local minimum. By adding a propor-tion of the previous weight change to the currentweight change (which will be very small in a local\\nminimum) it is possible that the weights can escape\\nthe local minimum.\\n4. MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON APPLICATIONS\\nIN GENERAL\\nThe multilayer perceptron has been applied to\\na wide variety of tasks, all of which can be categorisedas either prediction, function approximation, or pat-tern classiÞcation. Prediction involves the forecastingof future trends in a time series of data given currentand previous conditions. Function approximation is\\nconcerned with modelling the relationship between\\nvariables. Pattern classiÞcation involves classifyingdata into discrete classes. All of these applications areclosely related and can be treated as modiÞcations tothe following generic model.\\n4.1.„he generic multilayer perceptron application\\nThe objective is to Þnd an unknown function\\nfwhich relates the input vectors in Xto the output\\nvectors in ‰,\\n‰\"f(X)\\nwhere X\"[n]k],‰\"[n]j],nis number of train-\\ning patterns, kthe number of input nodes/variables\\nandjthe number of output nodes/variables.\\nDuring training the function fis optimised, such\\nthat the network output for the input vectors in Xis\\nas close as possible to the target values in ‰. The\\nmatrices Xand‰represent the training data. The\\nfunction f, for a given network architecture, is deter-\\nmined by the adjustable network weights.\\n4.2.Function approximation and prediction\\nBoth function approximation and prediction are\\nvery similar. It is usually the case that only one variableis modelled from the input data, hence the multilayer\\nperceptron will only have one output node, andthe dimensions of matrices Xand‰in the generic\\napplication are n]kandn]1, respectively. To use\\na multilayer perceptron for prediction involves trainingthe network to output the future value of a variable,given an input vector containing earlier observations.\\nThe multilayer perceptron approximates highly non-\\nlinear functions between Xand‰and requires no\\nprior knowledge of the nature of this relationship.\\nThis is one of the beneÞts multilayer perceptrons o¤erover conventional regression analysis. If the relation-ship between Xand‰is non-linear then linear regres-\\nsion is clearly an inappropriate tool, although it maybe possible to apply linear regression on a more local\\nbasis where the non-linearity can be dismissed.\\nNon-linear regression is useful if the nature of thenonlinearity can be found and if the non-linearity isconsistent over the entire range of measurements.Extremely non-linear relationships exist in the realworld and it is inappropriate to attempt to under-\\nstand these problems using traditional regression, at-\\ntributing scatter to the presence of ÔÔnoiseÕÕ. Underthese circumstances the multilayer perceptron isa useful tool. A good theoretical example of this pointis presented in Robinson (1991).\\n4.3.Pattern classiÞcation\\nTraditional pattern classiÞers assign a class to every\\nmeasurement vector in X. A classiÞer is said to parti-\\ntion the whole of measurement space, or the set of allpossible input vectors, into jdisjoint subsets each\\nrepresenting one of the jtarget classes. ClassiÞers aim\\nto minimise the probability of misclassiÞcation via\\nBayes theorem, classifying a new example to the classthat has the highest posterior probability. The poste-rior probability gives a measure of the likelihood ofa particular measurement vector belonging to a par-ticular class. An overview of Bayes theorem and pat-\\ntern classiÞcation techniques can be found in Bishop\\n(1995).\\nMultilayer perceptrons can be used for classiÞca-\\ntion by assigning output nodes to represent each class.For example, if a classiÞcation of an air mass waseither maritime, continental or polar, then the multi-\\nlayer perceptron will require three output nodes. The\\ntarget output vectors in the training data can beconsidered as binary vectors with a 1 indicating classmembership and a 0 indicating no membership. Inthis way, the maritime class would be represented byan output vector of [1, 0,0], continental [0,1,0], and\\npolar [0,0, 1]. Once trained the network can be pre-\\nsented with an unseen input vector. The output fromthe multilayer perceptron can be considered asa posterior probability; hence the Þnal classiÞcation\\ngoes to the node with the highest value. If, forexample, the output was [0.6,0.1,0.2] then the most\\nprobable classiÞcation would be maritime.\\nUnlike function approximation and prediction,\\nmultilayer perceptrons used for classiÞcation will2630 M. W. GARDNER and S. R. DORLINGhave more than one output node. The dimensions of\\nmatrices Xand‰in the generic application will be\\nn]kandn]j, respectively, where jis the number of\\npossible classes, and nandkare as before.\\nMultilayer perceptrons have been shown to be su-\\nperior to traditional classiÞcation approaches for sev-eral reasons (Benediktsson et al., 1990). Firstly, and\\nmost importantly, this approach does not require anyprior assumptions regarding the distribution of train-\\ning data. ClassiÞcations that use Bayes theorem rely\\non a Gaussian (normal) distribution of the data whichis often not the case in practical applications. AnotherbeneÞt of the multilayer perceptron approach is thatno decision regarding the relative importance of thevarious input measurements needs to be made; during\\ntraining the weights are adjusted to select the most\\ndiscriminating input measurements. Benediktssonet al. (1990) also make the point that with care the\\ntraditional classiÞcation algorithms can be made toclassify more accurately than a multilayer perceptron,but that this requires ÔÔsigniÞcantly more insight and\\ne¤ort on the part of the analystÕÕ. Multilayer percep-\\ntrons are no panacea.\\n5. MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON APPLICATIONS\\nIN THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES\\nThere is no space to discuss in detail all atmo-\\nspheric science applications of the multilayer percep-tron. Instead a brief overview of applications fromprediction, function approximation and pattern clas-siÞcation will be presented. It is hoped that these\\npapers illustrate the main principles of applying the\\nmultilayer perceptron to real-world atmosphericproblems. Other papers will be mentioned for refer-ence purposes.\\n5.1.Prediction\\nThe multilayer perceptron has been applied within\\nthe Þeld of air-quality prediction. The relationshipbetween meteorology and pollution is complex, andpotentially multi-scale in nature. Yi and Prybutok(1996) describe a multilayer perceptron that predictssurface ozone concentrations in an industrialised area\\nof North America. The model takes nine input vari-\\nables to predict the maximum daily surface ozoneconcentration. These variables include the morningozone concentration, the maximum daily temper-ature, CO2, NO, NO2and NOxlevels, and also wind\\nspeed and direction. Results from the multilayer per-\\nceptron were shown to be better than those obtained\\nfrom regression analysis (using the same input data).The authors also suggest that the multilayer percep-tron outperforms an ARIMA time-series modellingapproach, however such comparisons between tech-niques must be made with care. For example, to fairly\\ncompare an ARIMA time-series model with a multi-\\nlayer perceptron model, requires that both modelsare constructed using the same data. In Yi andPrybutoksÕ paper the multilayer perceptron was\\ntrained with all nine meteorological and chemicalvariables whilst the ARIMA model was constructed\\npurely from the ozone time series.\\nBoznar et al. (1993) constructed a multilayer per-\\nceptron to predict atmospheric sulphur dioxide con-centrations in a highly polluted industrialised area ofSlovenia. The objective of the work was to developa model that could make accurate short-term (hourly)\\npredictions of sulphur dioxide concentrations in order\\nto determine whether or not to reduce emissions froma coal-Þred power station. Previous work hademployed a numerical air dispersion model; due tocomplex topography in the region results were poor.Boznar et al. (1993) trained multilayer perceptrons to\\npredict sulphur dioxide concentrations at various sta-\\ntions in the study area for which data was available.The input data to the model were taken from stationsover a larger area and consisted of current and pre-vious observations of sulphur dioxide concentrationsand meteorological information. This illustrates how\\neasily disparate sources of data can be brought\\ntogether within a multilayer perceptron model. Re-sults from the model were ÔÔencouragingÕÕ (no perfor-mance statistics were given) and an on-lineimplementation of the software is being made at oneof the power stations where continuous air quality\\nmonitoring occurs.\\nComrie (1997) compares ozone forecasts made by\\nmultilayer perceptron and regression models. Theforecasts of summertime dailymaximum (one hour)\\nozone concentration for various U.S. urban areaswere made using average dailymeteorological input\\ndata. Comrie concluded that the neural network ap-\\nproach found no dramatic improvements when com-pared to linear regression, with only small tomoderate gains in model performance. In our viewthis is due to the nature of the daily data which doesnot represent the real non-linear ozone-meteorology\\nrelationship. It is likely that the neural network would\\nsigniÞcantly outperform regression at a sub-dailytimescale when the non-linearity of the system is moreapparent. By concentrating on the daily timescale thecomparison is carried out on an essentially linearsystem, hence the close performance of the two ap-\\nproaches.\\nPredicting severe weather is one of the ongoing\\nchallenges facing meteorologists. The dynamics of se-vere weather phenomena are not easily included incurrent numerical weather prediction models due totheir small scale and our limited understanding of\\nthem. Marzban and Stumpf (1996) trained a multi-\\nlayer perceptron to predict the existence of tornadoes.The approach outperformed other techniques includ-ing discriminant analysis, logistic regression anda rule-based algorithm. McCann (1992) trained multi-layer perceptrons to forecast the presence or absence\\nof signiÞcant thunderstorms. Results indicated that\\nthe multilayer perceptrons were picking up patternsthat skilled forecasters recognise as precursors toApplications in the atmospheric sciences 2631thunderstorms. McCann makes the point that since\\nthe exact nature of the interaction between the com-ponents that produce a thunderstorm, basically the\\nstability of the air and the presence of lifting mecha-\\nnisms, are not well understood, it would be desirableto know what the multilayer perceptron has learnt.McCann concludes, after several attempts, that it isÔÔpractically impossible to understand the ÔÔblack boxÕÕ.The conclusions of this study are not very satisfying to\\nscientists. Acceptance comes from how well the net-\\nworks have learned patternsÕÕ. This point will be fur-ther addressed in Section 6.\\nOther applications of multilayer perceptrons for\\nprediction include the forecasting of Indian monsoonrainfall (Navone and Ceccatto, 1994), Brazilian rain-\\nfall anomalies (Hastenrath and Greischar, 1993), daily\\nsolar radiation (Elizondo et al., 1994), crop damage by\\nozone (Benton et al., 1995), atmospheric dispersion of\\npollutants (Rege and Tock, 1996), solar activity(Macpherson et al., 1995), and carbon monoxide\\nlevels due to vehicle emissions at an urban road inter-\\nsection (Moseholm et al., 1996).\\n5.2.Function approximation\\nUnlike with prediction, function approximation\\naims to use the multilayer perceptron to better andmore fully model relationships between data. For\\nexample, Gardner and Dorling (1996) trained a multi-\\nlayer perceptron to model the relationship betweenhourly surface ozone concentration and various localmeteorological variables at a coastal location. Theobjective of this work was to assess the importance ofmeteorology in determining hourly surface ozone\\nconcentrations. The work illustrates that previous at-\\ntempts to address this problem were inappropriatesince the problem is non-linear. Linear regressionwas tending to underestimate the importance ofmeteorology.\\nThe multilayer perceptron has been used to model\\nnon-linear transfer functions and has found much use\\nin the retrieval of geophysical parameters from re-motely sensed data (Thiria et al., 1993; Butler et al.,\\n1996; Badran and Thiria, 1991; Clothiaux et al., 1994;\\nChurnside et al., 1994). Krasnopolsky (1995) de-\\nveloped a multilayer perceptron to model the transfer\\nfunction for special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I)\\nsurface wind speed retrieval. The multilayer percep-tron approach was shown to be as good as previousempirical algorithms for retrieving wind speeds. How-ever the performance of the multilayer perceptronunder cloudy atmospheric conditions was shown to\\nbe better than the conventional algorithms. This Þnd-\\ning was also supported by the work of Stogryn et al.\\n(1994), who claim an improvement of more than a fac-tor of two compared to alternative algorithms undernon-clear conditions. This paper illustrates thata well-trained multilayer perceptron can adjust the\\nrelationship being modelled depending on speciÞc\\nconditions due to the many interactions between in-put variablesÐusing a single transfer function forboth cloudy and clear conditions was found to be\\ninappropriate. One of the limitations of the multilayerperceptron approach was that wind speeds which\\nwere not well represented in the training data were\\nsubsequently poorly retrieved. The problem of select-ing suitable training data will be discussed inSection 6.\\n5.3.Pattern classiÞcation\\nGlobal climate change may be indicated in the\\nchanging distribution of clouds and cloud types, espe-cially in the polar regions. Multilayer perceptronshave been applied to the classiÞcation of satelliteimages to distinguish between clouds and ice or snow.Multilayer perceptrons have been shown to produce\\nbetter classiÞcations than discriminant analysis\\n(Welch et al., 1992; Tovinkere et al., 1993; Bankert,\\n1994). Cloud classiÞcation has been taken a step fur-ther by Peak and Tag (1992), who have developeda system to produce synoptic style analyses directlyfrom satellite imagery. The system was developed for\\nthe U.S. Navy to aid with the on-ship interpretation of\\nsatellite imagery, in particular for identifying the loca-tion of fronts, cyclones, severe weather and sea states.The system uses a combination of multilayer percep-trons for pattern recognition and an expert system toproduce the Þnal analysis. An introduction to expert\\nsystems can be found in Simons (1984).\\nMultilayer perceptrons have also been applied to\\nthe classiÞcation of atmospheric circulation patterns.Cawley and Dorling (1996) describe a system whichattempts to reproduce a manual classiÞcation of at-mospheric circulation patterns over the British Isles\\nknown as the Lamb Weather Types. Inputs to the\\nmultilayer perceptron consist of surface pressure ob-servations over a grid of points centred over theBritish Isles. The multilayer perceptron marginallyoutperformed a rule-based classiÞcation scheme. Suchan automated approach to circulation classiÞcations\\nis desirable since a manual scheme will contain dis-\\ncontinuities as authors change over time. The fre-quency of the Lamb Weather Types will be subject tovariations due to climate change. The ability to clas-sify the masses of output from climate simulationmodels in such an automated manner would be of\\ngreat use. Verdecchia et al. (1996) report on a similar\\napproach to determine the presence of a ÔÔblockingsituationÕÕ (a region of stationary high pressure) overEurope.\\nThe beneÞts a¤orded by the multilayer perceptron,\\nwhen used for pattern classiÞcation, have been clearly\\nobserved in work producing land cover classiÞcations\\n(Foody et al., 1995; Benediktsson et al., 1990; Chen\\net al., 1995; Foody, 1995). The generalisation capabil-\\nity of the multilayer perceptron, even when trained ona limited amount of data, has been used to reduce thetime and e¤ort involved in producing land cover clas-\\nsiÞcations from multi-spectral data (Hepner et al.,\\n1990). More recently, output from the multilayerperceptron has been interpreted as a fuzzy or soft2632 M. W. GARDNER and S. R. DORLINGclassiÞcation, and attempts to model mixtures of land\\ncover types have been made (Foody, 1996).\\nAnother application of the multilayer perceptron\\nto pattern recognition is in the classiÞcation of\\nconvergence lines from radar imagery (Hagelberg andHelland, 1995). Convergence lines represent preferredlocations for thunderstorm development. The abilityto automatically detect such features from radar im-ages would be of great use in aviation weather fore-\\ncasting. Finally, Miniere et al. (1996) report on the use\\nof a multilayer perceptron to classify electron andproton whistlers (lightning-related phenomena), inreal time, aboard magnetospheric satellites. This pa-per also presents a brief overview of multilayer per-ceptron applications in space physics.\\n6. LIMITS, PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS ÐBACK-\\nPROPAGATION AND THE MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON\\nIN PRACTICE\\nThe beneÞts of using multilayer perceptrons have\\nbeen illustrated. One of the reasons often cited for notusing multilayer perceptrons in practice, and artiÞcialneural networks in general, is that they are di¦cult toimplement and interpret. Although this is true toa certain degree, there is an abundance of useful in-\\nformation available that can assist in the process,\\nenabling common pitfalls to be avoided. Commercial-ly available software will often provide built in solu-tions to protect the user from many of the followingissues, however it is still important to have a basicunderstanding of the problems.\\nFurther discussion can be found in recent text-\\nbooks (e.g. Bishop, 1995) and in the neural networksnewsgroup frequently asked questions (FAQ) avail-able via the Internet (Sarle, 1997). Many of the prob-lems are common to all statistical modellingtechniques and will be mentioned to illustrate that\\nneural networks are not the solution to all problems\\nfacing statistical modelling. It must be stressedthat there have been many successful applications ofthe multilayer perceptron when trained using themost basic backpropagation algorithm. With care,some trial and error, and a theoretical under-\\nstanding of backpropagation, good results can be\\nobtained.\\nThe initial problem faced when using a multilayer\\nperceptron is deciding on the network architectureÐthe number of layers and nodes in those layers. Thereare no rules to help in this process. The number of\\ninput and output nodes is determined by the problem\\nat hand. Technically only one hidden layer is requiredto approximate any smooth measurable function be-tween inputs and outputs (Hornik et al., 1989). The\\noptimum number of nodes required in the hiddenlayer is problem dependent, being related to the\\ncomplexity of the input and output mapping, the\\namount of noise in the data and the amount oftraining data available. If the number of nodes in thehidden layer is too small the backpropagation algo-\\nrithm will fail to converge to a minimum duringtraining. Conversely, too many nodes will result in the\\nnetwork overÞtting the training data resulting in poor\\ngeneralisation performance.\\nThe principal of generalisation requires further at-\\ntention. Given some training data and a network withtoo many nodes and hidden layers, it is highly prob-\\nable that the network will eventually learn all the\\ntraining patterns in the training data a case of overÞt-\\nting. In a problem with noisy data the network wouldeventually learn all the noise in the training data.Since the noise can be assumed to be randomly dis-tributed, similar training patterns with di¤erent de-grees of noise would be seen as dissimilar by the\\nnetwork. When such an overtrained network is pre-\\nsented with a new pattern it is likely that the networkwill incorrectly classify it, since the pattern (and itsassociated random noise) will not have been observedin the training data. Reducing the number of hiddenlayers and nodes serves to act as a noise Þlter, forcing\\nthe network to ignore the small-scale noise and to\\nlearn the underlying patterns in the training data, thedesired situation.\\nIt is important to remember that the usual purpose\\nof training the multilayer perceptron is to achievegood generalisation on unseen data, for example in\\nprediction applications. Maximum generalisation\\nperformance will occur before the overall networktraining error reaches a minimum, as shown in Fig. 5.A network trained on a noisy set of data until the\\nglobal minimum is reached is overtrained. One way toensure this does not occur, and that the generalisation\\nperformance will be good, is to divide the training\\ndata into several setsÐa training set, a validation setand a test set. The training set is used to actually trainthe network. The validation set can be used to assessthe generalisation ability of the network whilsttraining is occurring. Training is stopped when the\\ngeneralisation performance reaches a maximum. This\\ntechnique is known as early stopping and is parti-cularly useful when training multilayer perceptronswith real world, noisy data. Finally, the test set is used\\nFig. 5. Training and validation errors with respect to train-\\ning time.Applications in the atmospheric sciences 2633to assess the overall performance of the trained net-\\nwork.\\nThere are two other factors that determine the level\\nof generalisation that will be obtained from a multi-\\nlayer perceptron. The Þrst concerns the relationshipthat the multilayer perceptron is attempting to ap-proximate. In particular, this function must besmooth, by which a small change in an input onlyresults in a small change in the output. Secondly, the\\ntraining data must be adequately extensive and also\\nrepresentative. Multilayer perceptrons perform wellwhen used for interpolation, but poorly if used forextrapolation. The training data must fully representall cases about which the multilayer perceptron willbe required to generalise from. If both these condi-\\ntions are satisÞed, and the multilayer perceptron is\\ntrained with a suitable training algorithm, then theperformance of the network will be good. Some fur-ther issues relating to the selection of training datacan be found in Lawrence (1991).\\nGiven a set of data, the question arises of how best\\nto divide the data into training, validation and test\\nsets, such that the conclusions drawn from the multi-layer perceptron are valid and performance isrepresentative. If, for example, the data are dividedrandomly there is a chance that the data in one of thesets may be biased towards extreme or uncommon\\nevents. This will cause problems when assessing the\\nperformance of the network. A network can onlygeneralise on the range of data inputs for which it wastrained. This is a particular problem when workingwith small data sets, when good or bad performancecould be related to the selection of the various data\\nsubsets. One way around this problem is known as\\nV-fold cross-validation, and involves randomly divid-ing the data into ÔÔVÕÕ independent subsets (Stone,1974). The multilayer perceptron is then trained oneach subset and its performance on the remain-ing data is recorded. The stability of the training can\\nthen be used to gauge the conÞdence that can be\\nplaced on the network performance when trained withall the data. An excellent overview of the problemsassociated with data modelling, and determiningmeasures of performance, can be found in Breimanet al. (1984).\\nOften, especially in the atmospheric sciences, suc-\\ncessfully modelling the average behaviour of a systemis not the desired goal. It is important that the modelcan resolve infrequent, extreme events which are oftenof great importance. Several approaches to overcomethis problem have been suggested, including data\\npre-processing, and by making adjustments to the\\ntraining algorithm so that well learnt patterns aretemporarily ignored from the training process (Listeret al., 1993).\\nDecisions need to be made in choosing suitable\\nvalues for the learning rate and momentum para-\\nmeters required by the backpropagation training al-\\ngorithm. The best values to use are problem-speciÞc.Le Cun et al. (1993) describe a process which candetermine the maximum possible value of the learning\\nrate. If a network fails to converge an increase inmomentum and a decrease in the learning rate may\\nhelp. If the network oscillates around a solution or\\nbecomes unstable then decreasing the learning ratemay result in convergence. The selection of suitablelearning parameters requires a degree of judgementand is perhaps the most unattractive aspect of thebackpropagation algorithm. More sophisticated algo-\\nrithms avoid the need to specify such sensitive train-\\ning parameters.\\nThere are many activation functions which can be\\nused in place of the logistic function. Virtually, allnon-linear functions could be used, however for thebackpropagation algorithm the function must be dif-\\nferentiable. Bounded functions are preferred, since\\nthese will prevent weights from taking very largevalues, slowing convergence during training. One al-ternative to the logistic function is the hyperbolictangent (tanh) function. Di¤erent layers in the net-work can have di¤erent activation functions. It is\\noften useful, for example, to have an unbounded func-\\ntion (usually the identity function y\"x) at the output\\nlayer. This enables the outputs to take a range ofvalues without being bounded to the limits of thefunction, for example between 0 and 1 for the logisticfunction.\\nRescaling input data between 0 and 1 is often re-\\nported in papers describing applications of the multi-layer perceptron. In theory this is unnecessary sinceany rescaling can be compensated for within the net-work by adjusting the input to hidden layer weights.In practice, initial network weights are chosen ran-\\ndomly. Therefore, if one input has a large range and\\nanother has a small range, but both exhibit a similaramount of variance, then the network may ignorethe small input due to the large contribution from theother input. It is therefore advisable to standardisethe inputs to the multilayer perceptron, by dividing\\nthe input by the standard deviation of all values in the\\ntraining data. This may also assist with the interpreta-tion of network weights.\\nBackpropagation is slow and is particularly a¤ec-\\nted by the ÔÔcurse of dimensionalityÕÕ (after Bellman,1961). As the dimensionality of the data increases, the\\namount of training data required by the multilayer\\nperceptron rapidly increases. Similarly, as the databecome more complex the number of weights, andhence the size of the network, rapidly increases. Boththese problems serve to slow the speed at which thebackpropagation algorithm will converge. One solu-\\ntion to this problem is to reduce the dimensionality of\\nthe input data, which can be achieved through the useof principal components, or by removing redundantvariables from the input data. This process is knownas feature selection (Setiono and Liu, 1996). An alter-native solution is to use a di¤erent algorithm. The\\nnumber of algorithms that exist, and all their deriva-\\ntives, make it very di¦cult to know which algorithmto turn to. There is not space here to discuss all such2634 M. W. GARDNER and S. R. DORLINGalgorithms. A good description of many algorithms\\ncan be found in Gibb (1996) or Battiti (1992).\\nOnce trained, multilayer perceptrons can represent\\nrelationships, often with surprising accuracy, that are\\nnot fully understood by the traditional theory. Tocomplete this introduction attention must be paid tothe ÔÔblack-boxÕÕ nature of the multilayer perceptron.No consensus opinion and related theory has beenproposed which enables an analysis of the network\\nweights to determine exactly what the multilayer per-\\nceptron has learnt. Techniques exist to determine therelative importance of the input variables (Sarle,1997). These techniques range from a straightforwardanalysis of the network weights in the input-hiddenlayer, through to more complex algorithms which\\ntake into account the hidden-output layer weights\\n(Garson, 1991). Other approaches involve calculatingpartial derivatives of the output with respect to thevarious inputs. All these approaches have their limita-tions and will often provide conßicting results. If theproblem that the multilayer perceptron is applied to is\\none of prediction, or classiÞcation, or the exact nature\\nof the input Ðoutput relationship is not important,\\nthen the ÔÔblack boxÕÕ limitation is of no consequence.If the multilayer perceptron is being applied to prob-lems where the desire is to increase the knowledge ofa physical process, and the interaction of driving\\nmechanisms, then the ÔÔblack-boxÕÕ limitation will re-\\nstrict the usefulness of the multilayer perceptron. Oneparticularly promising avenue of research involvespruning the network after training, removing redund-ant weights. The Þnal network, with much fewerweights, may be more easily analysed. Reed (1993)\\nprovides a valuable review of pruning algorithms.\\n7. CONCLUSION\\nThe multilayer perceptron has been shown to be\\na useful tool for prediction, function approximation\\nand classiÞcation. The practical beneÞts of a model-ling system that can accurately reproduce anymeasurable relationship is huge. The beneÞts of themultilayer perceptron approach are particularly ap-parent in applications where a full theoretical model\\ncannot be constructed, and especially when dealing\\nwith non-linear systems. The numerous di¦culties inimplementing, training and interpreting the multi-layer perceptron must be balanced against the perfor-mance beneÞts when compared to more traditional,and often inappropriate, techniques.\\nThere are many commercially and freely available\\nsoftware packages that enable users to implementneural networks relatively easily (Sarle, 1997). Suchsoftware is increasingly allowing neural networks tobe implemented in a similar manner to regression ordiscriminant analysis, shielding the user from di¦cult\\nparameter selection. Unfortunately, most packages\\nprovide only a limited number of training algorithms,which cannot be adjusted or adapted by the user.Writing your own code has the beneÞt of enabling\\nquick implementation of the most recent adaptationsto training algorithms. Since there are many alterna-\\ntives to standard backpropagation this has obvious\\nbeneÞts. Coding the algorithm by hand requires a fullunderstanding of the mechanisms by which the neuralnetwork learns and provides more insight into thetechnique. Whichever method is adopted, the full be-neÞts that neural networks o¤er can only be realised\\nthrough a fundamental understanding of the basic\\ntheory.\\nAcknowledgements ÐWe are grateful to Gavin Cawley,\\nSchool of Information Systems, University of East Anglia\\nand the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments,\\nand also to the School of Environmental Sciences, Univer-\\nsity of East Anglia, for supporting this work.\\nREFERENCES\\nBadran, F. and Thiria, S.

Introduction\\nTigers  (Panthera  tigris )  are  a  globally  endangered  species,  with\\ntheir  remaining  populations  throughout  South  Asia  threatened  pri-\\nmarily  by  habitat  loss,  prey  depletion,  and  illegal  killing  by  people\\n(Dinerstein  et  al.,  2007;  The  World  Bank,  2011 ).  Effective  tiger\\nmanagement  and  conservation  planning  requires  a  good  under-\\nstanding  of  tiger  population  dynamics  (Lindenmayer  et  al.,  1993;\\nMargules  and  Pressey,  2000 ).  Territoriality,  an  essential  character-\\nistic  of  many  wildlife  species  (Adams,  2001;  Burt,  1943 ),  plays  a\\ncrucial  role  in  the  population  dynamics  of  tigers  (Sunquist,  1981 ).\\nAs  demonstrated  in  various  wildlife  species,  for  example,  territorial\\nbehavior  inﬂuences  social  organization,  mating,  disease  transmis-\\nsion,  demography,  and  the  spatial  distribution  of  individual  animals\\n(Craft  et  al.,  2011;  Moorcroft  et  al.,  2006 ).

Grimm).on  population  regulation  (Dhondt  et  al.,  1992;  Wang  and  Grimm,\\n2007 ),  territoriality  likely  inﬂuences  the  susceptibility  of  tigers  to\\nanthropogenic and  natural  disturbances  (Letcher  et  al.,  1998 ).\\nIntegrating  territoriality  in  computer  models  of  tiger  popu-\\nlations  can  give  us  tools  to  evaluate  future  impacts  of  various\\nthreats.  However,  previous  models  of  tiger  population  dynamics,\\nwhile  making  important  contributions,  have  not  adequately\\nincorporated  territoriality.  For  example,  the  models  of  Kenney\\net  al.  (2014,  1995)  and  Karanth  and  Stith  (1999)  do  not  include\\nreal  spatial  data  or  dynamic  territories  and  are  therefore  not\\nuseful  for  simulating  tiger  population  response  to  changing  habitat\\nconditions  (e.g.,  infrastructure  development)  on  spatially  hetero-\\ngeneous  landscapes.  The  spatially  explicit  model  of  Ahearn  et  al.\\n(2001)  imposed  territory  sizes  on  males  and  females  and  did  not\\ninclude  conspeciﬁc  interactions,  thus  limiting  the  ecological  and\\nconservation  questions  that  the  model  can  address.  To  help  ﬁll\\nthese  information  gaps,  we  developed  and  implemented  a  spatially\\nexplicit  agent-based  model  (ABM)  of  tiger  population  dynamics\\nshaped  by  different  territorial  behaviors  of  males  and  females.  In\\nthis  paper  we  describe  the  model  and  how  it  has  been  tested  and\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.06.008\\n0304-3800/© 2015  The  Authors.  Published  by  Elsevier  B.V.

Territories  or  home  ranges  are  mechanisms\\nby  which  animals  acquire  resources  such  as  food,  but  also  shel-\\nter  and  mates  (Brown  and  Orians,  1970;  Burt,  1943 ).  As  such,  the\\nsize  and  spatial  structure  of  animal  territories  or  home  ranges  are\\nstrongly  related  to  environmental  resource  abundance  and  distri-\\nbution  (Mitchell  and  Powell,  2007;  Moorcroft  et  al.,  2006 ).  Since\\nterritory  size  is  correlated  with  food  productivity  across  landscapes,\\nthe  population  densities  of  many  bird  and  mammal  species  are\\ninversely  related  to  their  home  range  or  territory  sizes  (Makarieva\\net  al.,  2005 ).\\nTerritories  and  home  ranges  are  also  inﬂuenced  by  the  loca-\\ntion,  behavior,  and  identity  of  conspeciﬁcs.  Agonistic  interactions\\nbetween  animals in adjacent  territories  (or  core  parts  of  home\\nranges)  are  costly,  with  outcomes  including  loss  of  resources,\\nmates, injury, and  sometimes  death  (Jacobs  et  al.,  2008 ).  Direct\\ninteractions  with  neighbors  (e.g.,  ﬁghts)  and  indirect  interactions,\\nsuch as avoidance  of  negative  encounters,  can  inﬂuence  territory\\nsize  and  shape  (Moorcroft  et  al.,  2006 ).  In  general,  territory  size  is\\nreduced by interactions  among  neighbors  or  with  potential  settlers\\n(Adams,  2001 ).  Such  interactions  redistribute  resources  among\\ncompetitors,  affecting  individual  ﬁtness.  Agonistic  interactions  also\\nsomewhat  decouple  territory  size  and  shape  from  landscape  food\\nsupply  (Adams,  2001 ).\\nFurthermore,  for  many  wildlife  species,  including  conservation-\\npriority  species  like  the  tiger,  agonistic  interactions  between  males\\nfor  females  are  common  and  inﬂuence  male  territories  and  their\\nreproduction  in  a  different  way  than  females  (Bond  and  Wolff,\\n1999;  Creel,  1998;  Pusey  and  Packer,  1994;  Sunquist,  1981 ).  Male\\ncompetition  for  access  to  females,  for  example,  can  completely\\ndisplace  males  from  a  territory  (Piper  et  al.,  2000 ),  signiﬁcantly\\nreducing  ﬁtness  of  the  displaced  male.  Appropriation  of  a  male  ter-\\nritory  by  another  male  is  also  sometimes  followed  by  infanticide,\\ntriggering  estrous  in  the  resident  female  and  potentially  allowing\\nthe  new  male  to  quickly  sire  a  litter  with  her  (Barlow  et  al.,  2009;\\nPusey and  Packer,  1994 ).  The  signiﬁcant  consequences  of  male-\\nmale  competition  on  dispersal,  reproduction,  and  population  size\\nand  structure  provide  strong  rationale  for  developing  a  model  with\\nseparate  but  interacting  female  and  male  territory  processes.\\nABMs  (also  referred  to  as  individual-based  models)  have  the\\nﬂexibility  and  capacity  to  incorporate  these  principles  of  territo-\\nriality  (DeAngelis  and  Grimm,  2014 ).  ABMs  explicitly  represent\\nindividual  behaviors  and  local  interactions  (Grimm  and  Railsback,\\n2005;  Semeniuk  et  al.,  2011,  2012 ).  By  simulating  the  life  of  individ-\\nual  animals,  ABMs  operate  at  a  scale  at  which  population  dynamics\\nare  based  (DeAngelis  and  Mooij,  2005;  Letcher  et  al.,  1998 ).  Fur-\\nthermore,  in  an  ABM,  population  dynamics  are  not  pre-deﬁned  by\\naggregate-level  equations  but  emerge  due  to  events  and  behaviors\\nat  the  individual  level  (Grimm  and  Railsback,  2005;  Semeniuk  et  al.,\\n2012 ).  In  terms  of  territoriality,  individual  behaviors  and  interac-\\ntions  can  be  directly  informed  by  observations  in  the  ﬁeld  (Watkins\\net  al.,  2014 ),  if  they  exist,  or  used  to  guide  ﬁeld  data  collection.  An\\nABM  approach  is  especially  useful  for  modeling  species  inhabiting\\nspatially  heterogeneous  environments  and  for  which  social  dynam-\\nics  strongly  inﬂuence  population  structure  (DeAngelis  et  al.,  1998;\\nFederico  et  al.,  2013;  Watkins  et  al.,  2014 ).\\nABMs  have  incorporated  territories  and  home  ranges  in  the  past.\\nSome  of  the  earlier  uses  of  ABMs  integrated  territories  and  home\\nranges  into  population  models;  however,  they  treat  territories  and\\nhome  ranges  as  equal  or  static  in  size  or  represent  them  with\\noverly simplistic  shapes,  such  as  circles  (Ahearn  et  al.,  2001;  Grimm\\net  al.,  2003;  Kostova  et  al.,  2004;  Letcher  et  al.,  1998;  Wiegandet  al.,  2004 ).  Other  studies  have  explicitly  modeled  more  complex\\nshapes  and  sizes  of  territories  and  home  ranges  as  functions  of\\nintraspeciﬁc  interactions  and/or  resource  spatiotemporal  hetero-\\ngeneity  (Giuggioli  et  al.,  2011;  Mitchell  and  Powell,  2004;  Moorcroft\\net  al.,  2006;  Nabe-Nielsen  et  al.,  2013;  Van  Moorter  et  al.,  2009 ).\\nThese  studies  provide  very  useful  insights;  however,  they  do  not\\nintegrate  territory  or  home  ranges  into  population  dynamic  models.\\nThe  recent  models  by  Wang  and  Grimm  (2007,  2010)  and  Liu\\net  al.  (2013)  are  different,  as  they  incorporate  dynamic  territories\\ninto  population  modeling  of  the  common  shrew  (Sorex  araneus )\\nand  the  wood  mouse  (Apodemus  sylvaticus ),  respectively.  In  the\\nwood-mouse  model  (Liu  et  al.,  2013 ),  only  females  are  considered;\\nterritory  acquisition  is  based  on  vegetation  cover  and  the  presence\\nof  conspeciﬁcs.  In  the  common  shrew  model  (Wang  and  Grimm,\\n2007,  2010 ),  territory  acquisition  for  both  females  and  males  was\\nbased  mostly  on  food  resources,  although  males  preferred  locations\\nwhere  females  were  present.\\nOur  model thus builds  on  the  resource-based  acquisition  of\\nterritories  used  by  Wang  and  Grimm  (2007,  2010) ,  but  adds  fur-\\nther rules representing  interactions  between  females  and  males.\\nIn  our  model,  female  tiger  territories  ﬂuctuate  based  on  local  prey\\nbiomass production and  the  presence  of  neighboring  female  terri-\\ntories  (Smith  et  al.,  1987 ).  Male  tigers  try  to  overlap  the  territories\\nof multiple females,  with  young  males  challenging  resident  (i.e.,\\nterritory-holding)  males  for  access  to  their  females  (Smith,  1993;\\nSunquist,  1981 ).  Tigers  in  the  model  reproduce,  disperse,  estab-\\nlish  and  modify  territories,  and  die,  with  other  tigers  dispersing\\nto  and  establishing  territories  in  the  gaps  left  by  dead  tigers.  By\\napplying  the  model  to  Nepal’s  Chitwan  National  Park,  where  empir-\\nical  data  on  tigers  and  their  habitat  have  been  collected  for  several\\ndecades,  we  demonstrate  its  utility  at  simulating  tiger  population\\ndynamics  in  a  real  landscape.  The  model  presented  here  does  not\\ninclude  interactions  with  humans,  but  the  ultimate  purpose  of  the\\nmodel  is  to  explore  the  consequences  of  various  threats  on  tigers\\n(e.g.,  poaching  and  resource  depletion),  as  well  as  feedbacks  of  tiger\\nbehaviors  on  human  communities.  As  such,  the  model  can  be  a  use-\\nful  tool  for  informing  decision-makers  on  how  to  conserve  tigers\\nunder  uncertain  and  changing  future  conditions.\\n1.1.  Study  site  and  biological  background\\nThe  model  was  parameterized  for  Nepal’s  Chitwan  National\\nPark  (27◦20/primeN  to  27◦43/primeN,  83◦5/primeE  to  84◦46/primeE),  where  long-term\\ntiger  behavioral  and  ecological  data  have  been  collected  (Barlow\\net  al.,  2009;  Eisenberg  and  Seidensticker,  1976;  Seidensticker\\nand  McDougal,  1993;  Seidensticker  et  al.,  1999;  Shrestha,  2004;\\nSmith  and  McDougal,  1991;  Smith,  1993;  Smith  et  al.,  1999,  1987;\\nSunquist,  1981 ).  The  park  is  situated  in  south  central  Nepal  and\\nlocated  in  a  river  valley  basin  along  the  ﬂood  plains  of  the  Rapti,\\nReu,  and  Narayani  Rivers  with  an  elevation  range  of  150–815  m.\\nClimate  in  Chitwan  is  subtropical  with  a  summer  monsoon  season\\nfrom  mid-June  to  late-September,  and  a  cool  dry  winter.  The  park\\nconsists  of  Sal  (Shorea  robusta )  forest,  khair  (Acacia  catechu )  and\\nsissoo  (Dalbergia  sissoo )  riverine  forests,  and  grasslands  dominated\\nby  species  of  the  genera  Saccharum ,  Themeda ,  and  Imperata  (Carter\\net  al.,  2013;  Chaudhary,  1998 ).\\nTigers  are  obligate  carnivores  that  crop  approximately  10%  of\\navailable  prey  in  a  landscape,  with  females  in  Chitwan  consuming\\n5–6  kg  of  prey/day  (Karanth  et  al.,  2004;  Sunquist,  1981 ).  Tiger  prey\\nis  abundant  in  Chitwan,  consisting  primarily  of  spotted  deer  (Axis\\naxis),  barking  deer  (Muntiacus  muntjak ),  hog  deer  (Axis  porcinus ),\\nwild  boar  (Sus  scrofa ),  sambar  (Rusa  unicolor ),  and  gaur  (Bos  gau-\\nrus).  Prey  biomass  generally  corresponds  to  land  cover,  with  prey\\nbiomass highest  in  grassland/riverine  forest  complexes  (Eisenberg\\nand  Seidensticker,  1976;  Shrestha,  2004;  Smith  et  al.,  1987 ).N.

Female  tigers  are  indicated  with  orange  circle  and  female  territory  boundaries  are  orange.  Male  tigers  are  indicated  with  blue\\ntriangles and  male  territory  boundaries  are  blue.  (For  interpretation  of  the  references  to  color  in  this  ﬁgure  legend,  the  reader  is  referred  to  the  web  version  of  this  article.)\\nBoth  male  and  female  tigers  exhibit  site  ﬁdelity  and  maintain\\nexclusive  territories  that  are  not  shared  with  neighboring  adults\\nof  the  same  sex  (Seidensticker  et  al.,  1999;  Smith  et  al.,  1987;\\nSunquist,  1981 ).  Mean  tiger  territory  size  in  Chitwan  is  20.7  km2\\n(range  10–51)  for  females  and  54.4  km2(range  19–151)  for  males\\n(Smith  et  al.,  1987 ).  Male  territories  encompass  1–6  female  territo-\\nries  (Smith,  1993;  Sunquist,  1981 ).\\nFemale  tigers  breed  at  about  3  years  old  after  establishing  a\\nterritory.  Gestation  is  103  days  (Karanth  and  Stith,  1999 ).  Litter\\nsize  in  Chitwan  is  between  2  and  5  cubs  with  an  average  of  2.98\\n(Smith  and  McDougal,  1991 ).  Interbirth  period  is  approximately  2\\nyears,  however,  the  interbirth  period  can  be  considerably  shorter\\nif  a  mother’s  litter  has  died  (e.g.,  through  infanticide  by  adults\\nmales,  Sunquist  et  al.,  1999 ).  Tigers  disperse  when  they  are  about\\n2  years  old  and  search  for  a  location  to  establish  their  territory\\n(Smith,  1993 ).  Females  will  tend  to  settle  closer  to  their  natal  range\\n(mean 9.7  km,  range  0.2–33  km)  than  males  (mean  33  km,  range\\n9.5–66  km,  Smith,  1993 ).  Dispersing  tigers  have  higher  mortality\\nrates  than  resident  tigers  (Karanth  and  Stith,  1999 ).  Dispersing\\nmales  will  often  challenge  other  males  for  their  territory  and  access\\nto  females.  Infanticide  by  new  resident  male  tigers  is  common\\n(Barlow  et  al.,  2009 ).\\n2.  Model  description\\nThe model  description  follows  the  ODD  (Overview,  Design  con-\\ncepts,  Details)  protocol  for  describing  agent-based  models  (Grimmet al., 2010,  2006 ).  The  model  was  implemented  in  NetLogo  5.0.4\\n(Wilensky,  1999 )  and  the  program  used  to  simulate  the  tiger\\npopulation  on  Chitwan  National  Park,  Nepal,  is  available  in  the\\nSupplementary  Material.\\n2.1.  Purpose\\nThe  proximate  purpose  of  the  model  is  to  predict  the  dynamics\\nof  the  number,  location,  and  size  of  tiger  territories  in  response  to\\nhabitat  quality  and  tiger  density.  To  allow  for  predictions  to  new\\nconditions,  for  which  no  data  exist,  territories  are  not  imposed  but\\nemerge  from  the  tigers’  perception  of  habitat  quality  and  from  their\\ninteractions  with  each  other.  Tiger  population  dynamics  is  deduced\\nfrom  merging  territory  dynamics  with  observed  demographic  rates.\\nThe  ultimate  purpose  of  the  model,  which  will  be  presented  in\\nfollow-up  work,  is  to  explore  human-tiger  interactions.\\n2.2. Entities, state  variables  and  scales\\nModel entities are  the  square  spatial  units  or  habitat  cells  com-\\nprising  the  landscape,  male  and  female  tigers,  and  tiger  territories\\n(Fig. 1).

Simulations  were  carried  out  on  a  small  landscape  of  40  ×  40\\ncells (100 km2),  a  larger  landscape  of  128  ×  125  cells  (1000  km2),\\nand the  Chitwan  landscape  of  157  ×  345  cells  (3385  km2though\\nonly  1239  km2of  it  comprises  park).  The  boundaries  in  the  model\\nlandscapes  were  impermeable  (i.e.,  the  tigers  and  their  territories\\ncould  not  extend  beyond  the  boundaries).  The  small  landscape  size\\nwas  chosen  to  develop  and  test  the  models  of  behavior  and  ﬁne-\\nscale  interactions  of  a  few  tigers,  whereas  the  larger  landscape  size\\nwas  used  to  explore  interactions  of  a  larger  tiger  population.  In\\naddition,  many  protected  areas  are  approximately  the  same  size\\nas  the  large  landscape  (Sanderson  et  al.,  2006 ).  Lastly,  the  Chitwan\\nlandscape was  used  to  assess  how  well  the  model  ﬁts  observed  data.\\nA  time  step  in  the  model  corresponds  to  1  month  and  simulations\\nwere run  for  1–20  years.  One  month  is  a  suitably  long  enough  time\\nstep  for  tigers  to  establish  and  maintain  a  territory.  In  addition,\\nprevious  empirical  studies  reported  data  at  the  monthly  time  scale\\nallowing  for  comparison  with  model  results.\\n2.3.  Process  overview  and  scheduling\\nEach time  step  (1  month),  the  following  processes  are  processed\\nin  the  given  order  (Fig.  2).  Model  entities  are  processed  in  a  random-\\nized  order,  unless  stated  otherwise,  and  changes  in  state  variables\\nare updated  immediately.  The  submodels  implementing  these  pro-\\ncesses  are  described  in  detail  in  Section  2.7  below.  Note  that  in  theprogram there are  mutual links between  tigers  and  territory  cells,\\nand males  and  females,  which  implies  that  these  links  have  to  be\\nupdated every time a tiger  dies  or  a  territory  is  changed  or  lost;\\nthese technical  updates  are  not  described  in  the  following.\\n2.3.1. Mortality\\nDepends on  sex,  age,  and  on  whether  the  tiger  is  a  territory\\nholder  or  disperser.\\n2.3.2.  Update-age-stage-class\\nTigers age  and  develop  and  may  proceed  to  the  next  age  class,\\ni.e.,  cub,  juvenile,  transient,  or  breeder  (Karanth  and  Stith,  1999 ).\\n2.3.3. Female-select-location\\nUpon reaching  breeding  stage,  females  select  a  location  to  begin\\nestablishing  a  territory.\\n2.3.4.  Male-select-location\\nUpon reaching  breeding  stage,  males  select  a  location  to  begin\\nlooking  for  available  females.\\n2.3.5. Update-female-territory\\nFemales try  to  add  habitat  cells  to  their  territory  until  the  total\\namount  of  prey  available  reaches  a  certain  threshold.  They  select\\nnew  cells  based  on  their  prey  availability  and  presence  and  rank,\\nwhich  are  correlated  to  age,  of  other  females.  Within  a  time  step,\\nfemales  can  try  up  to  48  times  to  add  a  new  cell.  In  other  words,\\nfemales  can  potentially  add  up  to  3  km2to  their  territory  in  a  time\\nstep, which  is  approximately  the  area  added  per  month  observed\\nin  the  ﬁeld  (Sunquist,  1981 ).  If  the  resulting  set  of  habitat  cellsN.  Carter  et  al.  /  Ecological  Modelling  312  (2015)  347–362  351\\nFig.  2.

Female-starvation\\nFemales die  if  the  total  prey  production  within  their  territory  is\\nbelow  76  kg/month  (derived  from  Miller  et  al.,  2014 )  and  the  food\\nwithin  their  territory  has  not  increased.2.3.7.  Calculate-fem-centroid\\nCalculates the centroid of  female  territory,  i.e.,  the  cell  which\\nhas  the  average  X  and  Y  coordinates  of  cells  of  the  female’s  territory.\\nThese  centroids  are  used  to  assign  female  to  male  territories.\\n2.3.8. Establish-or-update-male-territory\\nA model  territory  is  established  or  updated.  The  selection  of\\nfemale  territories  to  be  added  to  a  male’s  territory  is  based  on  the\\nproximity of  female  territories  (their  centroids)  and  the  rank  of352  N.

Males  with  less  than  six  female  territories  may  add\\nterritories;  males  with  six  female  territories  may  replace,  if  pos-\\nsible,  the  female  whose  centroid  is  farthest  away  from  the  male’s\\nterritory  centroid  by  a  closer  female.  This  is  done  to  prevent  male\\nterritories  from  overlapping  substantially.\\n2.3.9.\\n Calculate-male-centroid\\nCalculates the centroids of  male  territories.\\n2.3.10.

Design  concepts\\n2.4.1.  Basic  principles\\nAcquisition and maintenance of  territories  reﬂect  fundamental\\necological relationships  between  organisms  and  their  environ-\\nment. How male and  female  territorial  animals,  like  tigers,\\nestablish, defend,  and  modify  territories,  can  be  related  to  basic\\nprinciples such  as  resource  requirements  and  dominance  relation-\\nships  (Adams,  2001;  Brown  and  Orians,  1970;  Burt,  1943;  Jacobs\\net  al.,  2008;  Moorcroft  et  al.,  2006 ).  Having  our  model  based  on  basic\\nprinciples  related  to  territory  establishment  allows  application  to\\nother regions  than  Chitwan  National  Park.  Furthermore,  the  model\\ncan  be  adapted  and  re-used  for  other  organisms  and  contexts.\\n2.4.2.\\n Emergence\\nTiger population  size  and  age  distribution  over  time  emerge\\nfrom  demographic  processes  and  territory  dynamics.  Female  ter-\\nritory  dynamics  emerge  from  prey  biomass  distribution  and\\ncompetition  with  other  females.  Male  territory  dynamics  emerge\\nfrom  female  territory  locations  and  competition  with  other  males.\\n2.4.3.\\n Adaptation\\nFemale tigers adapt  their  territories  to  changes  in  prey  biomass\\nand  the presence  of  adjacent  female  territories,  while  males  adapt\\ntheir  territories  to  the  number  and  location  of  nearby  female  terri-\\ntories  and  the  presence  of  adjacent  male  territories.\\n2.4.4.\\n Fitness\\nIndividual tiger ﬁtness  is  indirectly  modeled  as  access  to  prey\\nand  mates  through  the  formation  and  adaptation  of  territories.\\n2.4.5.\\n Interaction\\nCompetition for  habitat  cells  is  a  direct  interaction  for  both\\nfemales and  males.  Males  also  interact  directly  as  they  can  expel\\nother  males  from  their  territory  to  gain  access  to  females.  In  such\\ncases,  to  trigger  estrous  in  females,  infanticide  can  occur.2.4.6.  Sensing\\nFemales can sense total prey available  to  them  within  their\\nterritory and  the prey abundance  of  cells  neighboring  their  territo-\\nries.  Males  know  the  number  of  females  within  their  territory  and\\nnearby  as well  as  the  location  of  the  corresponding  female  territo-\\nries.  Females sense  whether  or  not  a  habitat  cell  adjacent  to  their\\nterritory  is owned by  another  female,  and  males  sense  whether  or\\nnot  other males  are  nearby.\\n2.4.7. Stochasticity\\nStochasticity was incorporated into  many  processes  to  account\\nfor  natural  variation. The initial locations and  ages  of  tigers,  mor-\\ntality, challenges between males,  females  taking  habitat  cells  from\\nadjacent  females, male selection  of  females  to  move  toward,  litter\\nsize,  gender of cubs,  and  mating  all  include  elements  of  stochastic-\\nity.  See  Section  2.7  for  details.\\n2.4.8.  Observation\\nIndividual  and  population-level  processes  were  observed.  These\\nincluded  reproduction  (i.e.,  litter  size  and  lifetime  reproductive  suc-\\ncess  for  females),  mortality  (i.e.,  infanticide  and  mortality  rates\\nfor different  age  classes),  dispersal  (i.e.,  distance  from  natal  range\\nto  post-natal  territory),  resource  selection  (i.e.,  prey  biomass  for\\nfemales  and  females  for  males),  male  and  female  land  tenure  (i.e.,\\ntime  that  breeding  animal  held  onto  territory  before  dying  or  dis-\\npersing),  territory  size  and  spatial  distribution,  and  tiger  population\\nsize  and  age  structure.\\n2.5. Initialization\\nPrey  biomass  production  rates  (kg/month/cell)  used  in  the  mod-\\nels  were  calculated  by  combining  empirical  rates  of  average  daily\\nprey  consumption  by  female  tigers  and  information  on  female  ter-\\nritory  sizes  in  Chitwan.  Speciﬁcally,  using  daily  consumption  rates\\nof  5.5  kg/day  (Sunquist,  1981 ),  we  estimated  that  female  tigers\\nconsume  167.3  kg/month.  Assuming  tigers  consume  10%  of  the\\nstanding  prey  biomass  (Karanth  et  al.,  2004 ),  then  1673  kg/month  is\\non  average  available  to  a  female  tiger  within  her  territory.  The  upper\\nand  lower  limits  of  prey  biomass  production  per  cell  were  then  cal-\\nculated  by  scaling  the  average  monthly  prey  biomass  available  to  a\\nfemale  in  her  territory  (1673  kg)  to  the  largest  (51  km2or  816  cells)\\nand  smallest  (10  km2or  160  cells)  observed  female  territory  sizes\\nreported  in  Smith  (1987).  Thus,  the  lower  limit  for  prey  biomass\\nproduction  was  2.05  kg/month/cell  (i.e.,  1673/816)  and  the  upper\\nlimit  was  10.46  kg/month/cell  (i.e.,  1673/160).  These  prey  biomass\\nproduction  values  were  used  for  various  simulation  experiments\\n(see  Section  2.8  below).\\n2.6.  Input  data\\nThe  current  model  version  does  not  include  any  input  of  data\\ndescribing  dynamics  in  drivers,  environmental  conditions,  or  dis-\\nturbances.  Future  model  versions,  however,  will  include  seasonal\\nvariations  in  prey  biomass  production  rate  and  human  distur-\\nbances.\\n2.7.  Submodels\\nAll  model  parameters  are  listed  in  Table  2.  For  some  of\\nthe  complex  submodels,  we  used  tags,  e.g.,  “R1”,  that  link  the\\ndescription  of  this  model  rule  to  the  corresponding  NetLogo\\ncode  in  the  program.  This  applies  to  “female-select-location”,\\n“male-select-location”, “update-female-territory”,  and  “establish-\\nor-update-male-territory”  processes.N.

The  observed  survival  rates\\nare  identical  to  those  used  in  Karanth  and  Stith  (1999) .  When  a\\nfemale  with dependent  offspring  (i.e.,  cubs  and  juveniles)  dies,  then\\nher  offspring die  as  well.  Tigers  die  when  they  reach  15  years  old,\\nconsidered  their maximum age  in  the  wild  (Smith  and  McDougal,\\n1991 ).\\n2.7.2. Update-age-stage-class\\nThe age  of each tiger  increases  by  1  month  at  each  time  step.\\nAge-classes  were  based on those used in  Karanth  and  Stith  (1999) .\\nTigers are considered “cubs”  from  birth to 12  months  old,  “juve-\\nniles” from 12 to  24  months old, “transient  females”  or  “transient\\nmales” from  24 to 36  months,  and  “breeding  males”  or  “breed-\\ning  females”  after  36  months  of  age.  Male  breeders  who  have  lost\\ntheir  territory  become  “ﬂoater”  males  with  a  mortality  rate  equal\\nto  transient  males.  Females  become  fertile  at  36  months.\\n2.7.3.\\n Female-select-location\\nWhen females  reach  3  years  they  move  to  a  location  where  they\\nestablish  the  origin  point  of  their  territory.  The  following  describes\\nthe  steps  involved  in  selecting  that  location.\\n1. The  female  identiﬁes  all  cells  within  33  km  of  her  natal  origin\\n(R1). We  chose  33  km  as  the  search  radius  because  this  is  the\\nmaximum  observed  distance  females  traveled  from  their  natal\\nrange  to  establish  their  home  range  in  Chitwan  (Smith,  1993 ).\\n2.  Of  those  cells,  she  identiﬁes  cells  that  have  no  other  female  ter-\\nritory  within  2  km  and  have  no  other  transient  female  present\\n(R2).\\n3. Of  those  cells  meeting  that  criteria,  she  selects  and  moves  to  the\\ncell  that  has  the  highest  mean  prey  within  2  km  (R3).\\n4.  If  no  cells  meet  that  criteria,  then  she  identiﬁes  cells  within  33  km\\nof  her  natal  range  that  have  no  other  female  territory  within  1  km\\nand  that  have  no  other  transient  female  present  (R4).\\n5.  Of  those  cells  meeting  that  criteria,  she  selects  and  moves  to  the\\ncell  that  has  the  highest  mean  prey  within  1  km  (R5).\\n6.  If  no  cells  meet  the  abovementioned  criteria,  then  she  dies  (R6).\\nThis  is  analogous  to  her  dying  from  no  food  because  she  is  unable\\nto  establish  a  territory  in  any  suitable  areas.\\n2.7.4.  Male-select-location\\nWhen males  reach  3  years  old  they  move  to  a  location  from\\nwhich  they  will  try  and  establish  a  territory.  The  following  describes\\nthe  steps  involved  in  selecting  that  location.\\n1. The  male  identiﬁes  the  centroids  of  all  female  territories  that\\n“belong”  to  a  male  and  those  that  do  not  belong  to  a  male  (R1).\\n2.  If  the  male  has  previously  lost  a  challenge  to  a  resident  male,\\nthen  he  distinguishes  those  females  belonging  to  unchallenged\\nand  challenged  males  (R2).\\n3.  The  ﬁrst  choice  for  the  male  is  to  move  to  the  closest  cell  within\\n66  km  of  his  natal  range  that  is  the  territory  centroid  of  a  female\\nnot  belonging  to  a  male  (R3).  The  male  cannot  move  to  that  loca-\\ntion  if  another  dispersing  male  has  already  moved  to  it.  This\\nensures  that  young  males  from  the  same  cohort  do  not  all  clump\\non  the  same  female.  The  natal  range  is  deﬁned  as  the  centroid  of\\nthe  dispersing  male’s  mother’s  territory  at  birth.  We  chose  66  km\\nas  the  search  radius  because  this  is  the  maximum  observed  dis-\\ntance  males  traveled  from  their  natal  range  to  establish  their\\nhome range  in  Chitwan  (Smith,  1993 ).\\n4.  If  no  “unoccupied”  female  exists  within  66  km,  then  the  male\\nwill  select  a  female  closest  to  his  natal  range  and  that  belongs  to\\nan unchallenged  male  (R4).  This  ensures  that  the  male  will  not\\ncontinually  challenge  the  same  resident  male,  and  instead  keepslooking  for  females  across  the  landscape.  Also,  no  other  dispers-\\ning  male  must  be  present  at  that  centroid.  If  a  male  without  a\\nterritory  moves  to  a  female’s  centroid  that  is  occupied  by  a  resi-\\ndent  male,  it  might  challenge  that  resident  male  in  the  next  time\\nstep  (see  Section  2.7.8 ).\\n2.7.5.\\n Update-female-territory\\nAdult breeding  females  update  the  size  and  shape  of  their  terri-\\ntories  based  on  the  location  of  prey  resources  and  adjacent  female\\nterritories.  The  following  steps  are  involved  in  updating  territories\\nfor  female  tigers  (Fig.  3).\\n1. Cells  neighboring  an  existing  female  territory  are  categorized  as\\nbeing  vacant  (i.e.,  not  belonging  to  another  female’s  territory)  or\\nowned  by  another  female  (R1).  Neighbors  are  deﬁned  as  the  four\\ncells  sharing  a  border  (not  a  vertex)  with  the  territory  cells.  This\\nallowed  territories to  be  more  concentrated  in  space.\\n2.  If  the  cell  is  owned,  then  the  female  determines  if  the  owner\\nfemale  is  “subordinate”  to  her  (R2).  This  is  based  on  age,  with\\nmiddle-aged  females  being  the  most  dominant,  young  adult\\nfemales  moderately  dominant,  and  older  females  the  least  dom-\\ninant;  the  dominance  relationships  are  listed  in  Table  S1,  which\\nis  implemented  in  the  NetLogo  procedure  subord? .\\n3.  If  there  are  neighboring  cells  not  owned  by  other  females,  then\\nshe  will  add  a  vacant  neighboring  cell  with  the  highest  prey\\nbiomass  production  (R3).\\n4.  If  there  are  both  vacant  and  subordinate  cells  and  if  a  vacant\\nneighboring  cell  has  an  equal  or  higher  prey  biomass  production\\nthan  a  neighboring  cell  owned  by  a  subordinate  female,  then  she\\nadds  the  vacant  cell  to  her  territory  (R4).\\n5.  If,  instead,  the  highest  prey  biomass  production  of  a  neighbor\\ncell  belonging  to  a  subordinate  female  is  greater  than  the  highest\\nprey  biomass  production  of  a  vacant  neighboring  cell,  then  she\\nhas  a  25%  probability  of  adding  the  cell  from  the  subordinate\\nfemale  to  her  own  territory  (R5).  Otherwise,  she  adds  the  vacant\\ncell  even  though  it  has  a  lower  prey  biomass  production  than  the\\ncell  from  the  subordinate  female  (R6).\\n6.  If  there  are  no  vacant  neighbor  cells,  then  she  adds  the  cell\\nbelonging to  a  subordinate  female  with  the  highest  prey  biomass\\nproduction  (R7).  Although  females  are  highly  territorial  and\\nsometimes  demonstrate  aggression  toward  each  other  along  the\\nedges  of  their  respective  territories,  doing  so  incurs  a  cost  (Smith\\net  al.,  1987 ).  In  other  words,  a  female  does  not  attempt  to  co-opt\\na  portion  of  another  female’s  territory  unless  it  is  necessary  and\\nbeneﬁcial  to  her.\\n7.  Addition  of  new  cells  to  her  territory  ceases  when  10%  of  all\\navailable  prey  biomass  production  (i.e.,  prey  biomass  cropped\\nby  tigers,  Karanth  et  al.,  2004 )  in  her  territory  within  one  time\\nsteps  equals  167.3  kg/month  (Table  2)  (R8).\\n8.  Females  can  also  shift  their  territories  in  space  if  nearby  prey\\nresources  are  higher  than  those  currently  obtained  within  the\\nfemale’s  territory.  A  female  achieves  basal  metabolic  energy\\ndemands  when  she  has  access  to  76  kg/month  of  prey  within\\nher  territory  (Table  2).  This  number  is  based  on  estimates  of\\nenergetic  requirements  (2.5  kg/day)  applied  to  female  tigers  in\\nBangladesh  (Miller  et  al.,  2014 ).  A  female  will  replace  a  cell  from\\nthe  edge  of  her  territory  with  the  lowest  prey  biomass  produc-\\ntion  with  a  neighboring  cell  of  higher  prey  biomass  production\\nonce  she  has  met  her  energetic  minimum  of  76  kg/month  within\\nher  territory  (R9).  The  edge  of  her  territory  consists  of  all  the\\ncells  in  her  territory  that  share  exactly  one  border  with  another\\nterritory  cell.\\n9.  The  territory  must  be  contiguous,  with  all  cells  sharing  at  least\\none border  with  each  other.  If  gaps  occur  between  cells,  then\\nthe  female  moves  to  the  largest  group  of  cells,  and  all  smaller,N.  Carter  et  al.  /  Ecological  Modelling  312  (2015)  347–362  355\\nFig.  3.  Structure  of  female  tiger  territory  submodel.\\nisolated  groups  of  cells  (or  single  cells)  are  removed  from  the\\nterritory (R10; procedures ﬁnd-clusters ,  remove  clusters ).\\n2.7.6.  Female-starvation\\nFemales die  if  the  total  prey  within  their  territory  is\\n<76 kg/month (i.e.,  basal  metabolic  requirement)  and  the  food\\navailable  to  them  within  their  territory  did  not  increase  from  the\\nprevious time step.  Non-increasing  access  to  food  in  her  territory\\nindicates  that  she  is  hemmed  in  by  other  dominant  females  and  is\\nunlikely to ascertain  more  food.  If  the  starving  female  has  offspring,\\nthen  they  die  as  well.\\n2.7.7. Calculate-fem-centroid\\nThe centroids  of  all  female  territories  are  determined  and\\nassigned  to  their  respective  female.  The  centroid  is  determined\\nby  the  arithmetic  means  of  the  X  and  Y  coordinates  of  all  cells\\nbelonging  to  the  female’s  territory.  The  state  variable  “owner-fem-\\ncentroid”  of  the  cell  at  the  centroid’s  location  is  assigned  to  the\\nfemale  territory  holder.\\n2.7.8. Establish-or-update-male-territory\\nAdult males establish  or  update  the  size  and  shape  of  their  terri-\\ntories  based  on  the  location  of  nearby  adult  females  and  other  adult\\nmales.  Essentially,  a  male  territory  represents  all  the  territories  of\\nfemales  that  he  has  exclusive  access  to.  Male  territories  contract\\nor  expand  when  they  lose  or  gain  access  to  female  territories.  A\\nmale  territory  can  overlap  a  maximum  of  six  female  territories\\n(Sunquist,  1981 ).  The  “establish-or-update-male-territory”  sub-\\nmodel  requires  information  about  the  territory  centroids  of  females\\nand  males.  Territory  centroids  are  calculated  in  the  “calculate-fem-\\ncentroid”  and  “calculate-male-centroid”  processes.  The  following\\ndescribes  the  steps  involved  in  establishing  and  updating  a  male’s\\nterritory  (Fig.  4).\\n1. If male  already  has  a  territory  comprising  one  or  more  female\\nterritories  (i.e.,  he  is  a  resident  male),  then  his  territory  size  andshape  is  updated  based  on  changes  in  territories  of  the  females\\nhe already overlaps (R1).\\n2. If  a  male  does  not  have  access  to  any  females  (i.e.,  dispersing\\nmale), then he identiﬁes all  of  the  females  that  have  territory\\ncentroids within  3  km  of  himself  (Table  2,  R2).\\n3. If a male  is  a  resident  breeder  (i.e.,  already  overlaps  female\\nterritories), then  he  identiﬁes  all  females  that  have  territory\\ncentroids within 3 km of  the  territory  centroids  of  the  females\\nhe overlaps  (R3).  This  allows  the  male  to  expand  his  territory\\nbased on the location  of  female  territories  already  within  his\\nterritory.\\n4.  In some  cases,  a  female  territory  centroid  is  beyond  3  km  but\\nher  territory  shares  a  border  with  the  resident  male’s  territory\\n(i.e.,  the  combined  territories  of  the  females  he  overlaps).  We\\nassume  that  a  male  would  be  aware  of  this  neighboring  female\\nbased  on  territorial  markings  (Smith  et  al.,  1987 ).  Thus,  the\\nresident  male  also  identiﬁes  those  neighboring  females  (R4).\\n5.  Of  the  nearby  females  (i.e.,  within  3  km  or  sharing  a  territorial\\nborder),  the  male  identiﬁes  which  of  them  do  not  “belong”  to\\nanother  male.  He  then  adds  the  territories  of  the  closest  avail-\\nable  females  to  his  own  (R5).  If  the  male  already  has  access\\nto  six  females,  then  he  cannot  add  any  more  even  if  they  are\\navailable.\\n6. However,  if  the  centroid  of  an  available  female’s  territory  is\\ncloser  than  the  farthest  territory  centroid  of  a  female  belonging\\nto  a  male  with  six  females,  then  he  will  replace  the  farthest\\nfemale  with  the  closer  female’s  territory  (R6).  This  reﬂects  the\\nidea  that  it  is  energetically  more  efﬁcient  to  defend  a  territory\\nwith  females  that  are  closer  to  each  other.\\n7.  If  no  available  females  are  nearby,  a  dispersing  male  identiﬁes\\nall  nearby  females  belonging  to  other  males  (R7).  The  following\\nbehaviors  (8–10)  do  not  apply  to  “ﬂoater”  males,  as  they  pre-\\nviously  lost  their  territory  and  do  not  initiate  challenges  with\\nresident  males  any  longer.\\n8. The  dispersing  male  (excluding  ﬂoaters)  randomly  chooses  one\\nof  the  males  overlapping  those  nearby  female  territories  to\\nchallenge  for  access  to  his  female(s)  (R8).  The  dispersing  male356  N.  Carter  et  al.  /  Ecological  Modelling  312  (2015)  347–362\\nFig. 4. Structure  of  male  tiger  territory  submodel.\\ncannot  challenge  a  resident  male  that  he  has  lost  to  in  the  past.\\nThe  probability  of  various  outcomes  of  the  challenge  is  listed  in\\nTable  3  (NetLogo  procedure  prob-winning ).\\n9.  If  the  dispersing  male  wins  the  challenge,  he  adds  the  territory\\nof  the  female(s)  previously  belonging  to  the  resident  male  to\\nhis  own  territory  (R9).  If  the  females  had  offspring,  then  there\\nis  a  certain  probability  that  they  die  due  to  infanticide  (R10),\\na  commonly  observed  phenomenon  in  the  wild  among  terri-\\ntorial  animals.  Probabilities  that  a  cub  and  juvenile  die  due  to\\ninfanticide  are  in  Table  2.  These  probabilities  are  based  on  the\\nempirical  data  from  African  lions  (Pusey  and  Packer,  1994 ).\\n10.  If  the  dispersing  male  loses  the  challenge,  but  survives,  then  he\\ncontinues  dispersing.  He  remembers  the  male  he  lost  to  (R11)\\nand  cannot  challenge  him  again  in  the  future.\\n2.7.9.

Parenting\\nAfter giving  birth  to  a  litter,  a  female’s  offspring  are  dependent\\non her for 2 years.  During  that  time  she  is  not  fertile  and  hence  inca-\\npable of  giving  birth  to  another  litter.  In  this  submodel,  parenting\\ntime starts at  zero  when  litter  is  born  and  parenting  time  increases\\nby  one  each  time  step.  If  parenting  time  is  24  (i.e.,  2  years),  unless\\ninduced by infanticide,  the  female  becomes  “fertile”  again  and  is\\ncapable  of  giving  birth  to  another  litter  if  she  is  within  an  adult\\nmale’s  territory.  At  that  time,  the  cubs  turn  2  years  and  become\\ntransients.\\n2.7.11. Gestation  and  give-birth\\nOnce  pregnant  the  female  gestates  for  3  or  4  months.  She  is  no\\nlonger  fertile  during  that  period.  Since  gestation  is  about  103  days\\nin  the  wild,  the  model  randomly  selects  3  or  4  months  as  the  ges-\\ntation  period  so  that  the  average  gestation  period  for  all  females\\nis  approximately  3.5  months.  In  this  submodel,  gestation  time  is\\nreduced  by  one  each  time  step.  If  gestation  time  is  zero,  the  female\\nproceeds  to  reproduce  (see  NetLogo  procedure  give-birth ).  She  gives\\nbirth  to  a  litter  of  size  and  male:female  ratio  according  to  proba-\\nbilities  in  Table  2.  Each  offspring  stays  within  the  territory  of  its\\nmother  until  it  becomes  a  transient  adult.\\n2.7.12. Prob-mating\\nOnce females  reach  the  age  of  36  months  or  3  years,  they  become\\nfertile  and  are  capable  of  giving  birth  to  litters.  They  have  a  90%\\nannual  probability  of  successfully  mating  within  their  ﬁrst  repro-\\nductive  year.  That  probability  increases  to  100%  after  they  turn  4\\nyears  of  age.\\n2.7.13. Plotting\\nPlots of total  population  size,  age  structure,  and  territory  sizes\\nof  males  and  females  are  updated  each  time  step.\\n2.7.14. Calc-homerange\\nUsing the  package  “adehabitat”  in  the  R  software  (R\\nDevelopment  Core  Team,  2009 ),  the  100%  minimum  convex  poly-\\ngon  (MCP)  surrounding  each  female  and  male  territory  is  drawn.N.  Carter  et  al.  /  Ecological  Modelling  312  (2015)  347–362  357\\nThe  MCP  is  used  to  visualize  each  territory  and  compare  to  empiri-\\ncal  results  from  the  ﬁeld.  NetLogo  and  R  were  linked  by  using  the  R\\nextension  for  NetLogo  (Thiele  and  Grimm,  2010 ).  For  runtime  rea-\\nsons,  this  procedure  was  not  used  when  numerical  output  of  the\\nmodel  was  produced.\\n2.8.  Simulation  experiments\\nWe  conducted  various  simulation  experiments  on  different\\nlandscapes  to  illustrate  and  assess  model  behavior.  First,  the  model\\nwas  simulated  on  a  40  ×  40  landscape  with  four  different  prey\\nbiomass  patterns:  homogenous  (prey  biomass  production  of  5  kg),\\nrandom  (prey  biomass  production  between  2.05  and  10.46  kg),\\nsmoothed  random  (a  moving  window  passed  over  each  cell  to\\ncreate  slight  gradient),  and  left-right  gradient  going  from  lowest\\n(2.05  kg)  to  highest  (10.46)  prey  biomass  production.  We  used  these\\ndifferent  patterns  to  visualize  conﬁgurations  of  1–4  female  terri-\\ntories.  No other outputs  were  evaluated.  These  simulations  were\\nrun  for  12  time  steps  (1  year)  with  reproduction  and  mortality\\nprocesses turned off.\\nThe  model  was  then  simulated  on  125  ×  128  landscape  to  exam-\\nine how a  single  female  territory  size  varies  with  respect  to  habitat\\nquality,  i.e.,  cell-based  prey  biomass.  We  ﬁrst  created  a  “reference”\\nlandscape, in which  the  prey  biomass  production  at  each  cell  was\\ndrawn  from  a  uniform  distribution  with  the  bounds  set  to  the  lower\\n(2.05  kg/cell/month)  and  upper  (10.46  kg/cell/month)  limits  of  prey\\nbiomass  production  derived  from  Chitwan  data.  Next,  we  created\\nlandscapes  where  the  prey  biomass  production  values  varied  from\\n10%  to  200%  of  those  selected  from  the  uniform  distribution  used\\nin  the  reference  landscape.  The  simulation  was  run  for  12  time\\nsteps  and  replicated  100  times  for  each  parameterization  with  a\\nrandom  seed  to  assess  variation.  Reproduction  and  mortality  pro-\\ncesses  were  turned  off.  Aside  from  female  territory  size,  no  other\\nmodel  outputs  were  evaluated.\\nWe  also  assessed  how  mortality  processes,  such  as  female  star-\\nvation,  male  challenges,  and  infanticide,  are  density  dependent  in\\nthe  model.  We  created  a  125  ×  128  landscape  with  prey  biomass\\nproduction  per  cell  set  to  the  midpoint  (6.255)  of  the  lower  (2.05  kg)\\nand  upper  limit  (10.46  kg)  in  Chitwan.  The  model  was  initialized\\nwith 50  adult  females  and  20  adult  males.  The  distributions  were\\nrandom  while  making  sure  that  initial  positions  of  females  were  not\\ncloser  than  12  cells  (3  km)  and  males  were  not  closer  than  20  cells\\n(5  km).  The  ages  of  the  adult  tigers  were  randomly  selected  from\\na  range  of  adult  breeding  ages  (≥3  and  <11  years  old).  Mortality\\nwas  deactivated  over  the  ﬁrst  4  years  to  get  territories  established\\nand  reach  quasi-stationary  (i.e.,  stable  population  size  over  time)\\npopulation  dynamics  more  rapidly.  Once  the  population  reached  a\\nquasi-stationary  point  after  200  time  steps,  50%  of  the  adult  females\\nand  males  were  removed  from  the  model,  and  then  various  mor-\\ntality  processes  and  total  tiger  population  size  were  evaluated  for\\nthe  next  20  years.  Simulations  were  replicated  5–50  times  with\\na  random  seed  to  assess  variation.  The  standard  deviation  in  sev-\\neral  model  outputs  appeared  to  stabilize  after  30  replications,  so\\nwe  therefore  assessed  model  outputs  for  all  subsequent  analyses\\nusing  32  replicates  (4  nodes  with  8  processors;  see  Supplementary\\nMaterials  and  Table  S2).\\nThe  model  was  then  simulated  on  the  Chitwan  National\\nPark,  157  ×  345.  We  rescaled  the  minimum  and  maximum  prey\\nabundances  per  cell  across  Chitwan  estimated  using  Geographic\\nInformation  Systems  (see  Supplementary  Material)  to  the  lower\\nand  upper  limits  of  prey  biomass  production.  Initially  28  adult\\nfemale  tigers  were  released  within  the  park  based  on  observed  indi-\\nviduals  in  Karki  et  al.  (2013) .  Because  tiger  density  is  higher  in  the\\nlowland  portion  of  the  park,  we  distributed  4/5  of  females  in  the\\nlowlands and  1/5  in  the  Churia  hills  (Karki  et  al.,  2013 ).  The  dis-\\ntributions  were  random  while  making  sure  that  initial  positions  offemales  were  not  closer  than  12  cells  (3  km).  Female  territories  ini-\\ntially  consisted  only  of  the  cell  of  their  origin  location.  Similarly,  14\\nadult  males  (equal  to  observed  males  in  Karki  et  al.,  2013 )  were  dis-\\ntributed  randomly  in  the  landscape  (4/5  in  lowlands,  1/5  in  Churia\\nhills)  with  a  minimum  distance  of  20  cells  (5  km),  but  they  did  not\\ninitially  have  a  territory.  The  ages  of  the  adult  tigers  were  randomly\\nselected  from  a  range  of  adult  breeding  ages  (≥3  and  <11  years  old).\\nMortality  was  deactivated  over  the  ﬁrst  4  years  to  get  territories\\nestablished  and  reach  quasi-stationary  population  dynamics  more\\nrapidly.\\nThe  Chitwan  simulation  was  allowed  to  reach  a  quasi-stationary\\npoint  after  200  time  steps,  and  then  model  output  was  evaluated\\nfor  the  next  20  years.  Simulations  were  replicated  32  times  with\\na  random  seed  to  assess  variation.  All  processes  were  turned  on\\nfor  these  simulations.  All  model  outputs  were  evaluated,  includ-\\ning  those  related  to  reproduction,  mortality,  dispersal,  resource\\nselection,  male  and  female  land  tenure,  territory  size  and  spatial\\ndistribution,  and tiger population  size  and  age  structure.\\nA  local  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  Chitwan  model  was  per-\\nformed by varying  key  input  parameters  from  their  reference\\nvalue  and  comparing  outputs.  Speciﬁcally,  sensitivity  was  calcu-\\nlated as the  ratio  of  the  relative  change  of  the  parameter  ((reference\\nvalue  −  new  value)/reference  value)  and  the  relative  change  of  the\\noutput quantity. Outputs  were  tiger  population  size,  total  breed-\\ning  animals,  and  female  territory  size  over  time.  Most  parameters\\nwere  varied  by  ±5%  from  their  reference  value.  For  integers,  we\\nselected  the  next  value  below  and  above.  For  distance  parameters,\\nsuch  as  maximum  dispersal  distances,  we  selected  values  0.5  km\\nbelow  and  above  the  reference  value.  If  a  parameter  was  set  to  a\\nmaximum,  i.e.,  100%,  then  we  only  selected  a  lower  value.  For  litter\\nsize,  deﬁned  by  a  probability  distribution,  we  tried  two  alternative\\ndistributions,  one  that  was  steeper  and  one  that  was  ﬂatter  than  the\\nreference.  We  simulated  each  parameterization  for  120  months  (10\\nyears)  after  discarding  the  ﬁrst  200  runs,  and  replicated  32  times\\nwith  a  random  seed  to  assess  variation.\\n3.  Results\\nFemales  establish  territories  that  overlap  areas  with  highest\\nprey  biomass  available  to  them  (i.e.,  not  already  taken  by  a  neigh-\\nboring  female),  with  the  territory  shape  and  size  corresponding  to\\nthe  spatial  distribution  of  prey  (Fig.  5).  When  simulated  on  a  larger\\nlandscape,  average  female  territory  size  has  a  power  law  relation-\\nship  with  the  landscape-level  average  prey  biomass  (Fig.  6).  Further,\\nas  population  size  increased  following  removal  of  50%  of  adults,\\nrates  of  infanticide,  male  deaths  from  challenges,  and  adult  female\\ndeaths  more  than  doubled  (Fig.  7  and  Table  4).  These  rates  eventu-\\nally  leveled  off  and  the  tiger  population  stabilized  after  20  years  on\\nthis  artiﬁcial  landscape.\\n3.1.  Model  testing\\nWe  compared  a  number  of  model  outputs  across  a  20-year  time\\nframe  to  empirical  data  on  tiger  behavior  and  ecology  in  Chitwan.\\nBy  comparing  model  output  to  several  patterns  observed  in  the\\nﬁeld  we  can  increase  our  conﬁdence  that  the  model  performed  well\\n(Grimm  et  al.,  2005 ).\\n3.1.1. Reproduction\\nAverage litter size  in  the  model  was  2.98  cubs  (SD  =  0.69  cubs),\\nwhich  not  surprisingly  corresponds  exactly  to  observed  litter  sizes\\nin  Chitwan,  as  litter  sizes  were  directly  imposed  in  the  model.\\nFemales  gave  birth  to  an  average  of  12.46  cubs  (SD  =  7.85)  during\\ntheir  lifetime,  suggesting  that  females  gave  birth  to  an  average  of  4\\nlitters. Similarly,  long-term  ﬁeld  data  from  Chitwan  indicated  that\\nfemales  had  4–5  litters  over  their  lifetime  (Smith  and  McDougal,358  N.

Mortality\\nThe  mean  number  of  cubs  and  juveniles  that  died  from  infan-\\nticide per month  in  the  model  was  1.47  (SD  =  3.58).  Observed\\ninfanticide  rates  can  be  high  in  Chitwan,  with  12  cubs  from  a  portion\\nof  the  park  believed  to  have  died  due  to  infanticide  in  the  span  of\\n1  year  (Barlow  et  al.,  2009 ).  Although  not  directly  comparable  to\\nmodel  output,  the  observed  rates  indicate  that  an  average  of  >1\\ninfanticide  per  month  across  the  park  is  within  reason.  An  average\\nof  0.54  females  (SD  =  0.78)  died  per  month  in  the  model,  and  an\\naverage  of  0.3  males  (SD  =  0.6)  died  per  month  from  challenges.3.1.3.

Discussion\\nTo  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  ﬁrst  ABM  to  simulate\\nboth female acquisition of spatially heterogeneous  food  resources\\nand male  acquisition  of  females  through  agonistic  interactions.  In\\nthe  model, females search for the  best  prey  resources  near  them\\nand\\n add  those  resources  to  their  territories,  which  are  exclusive\\nof other females. Female  territories  are  constantly  being  modiﬁed\\ndue  to  the  presence  of  neighboring  females  that  are  competing\\nfor  the  best  prey  resources.  Males  seek  exclusive  access  to  as\\nmany  females  as  possible  to  increase  their  reproductive  poten-\\ntial. To claim  females,  males  establish  territories  that  encompass\\nthe  territories  of  those  females  he  can  successfully  defend  from\\nother  males.  We  also  demonstrate  how  these  distinct  territorial\\nbehaviors,  interwoven  with  reproduction,  dispersal,  and  mortality\\nprocesses,  regulate  population  structure  on  a  landscape  represent-\\ning  Chitwan  National  Park,  Nepal.\\nInter-  and  intra-sexual  dynamics  mediated  by  habitat  qual-\\nity  across  the  model  landscapes  reproduced  several  patterns  we\\nexpect  from theories about  resource  use  and  conspeciﬁc  inter-\\nactions.  For  example,  territory  size  reﬂected  food  productivity,\\nwith average territory  size  decreasing  predictably  with  increas-\\ning  landscape-level  prey  resources.  In  addition,  individuals  in  the\\nmodel  demonstrate  habitat  preference,  with  territories  being  opti-\\nmized  to  overlap  areas  with  the  highest  prey  biomass.  Territorial\\ndynamics  also  regulate  populations.  For  example,  adult  male  deaths\\ndue  to  challenges  for  females  increase  as  the  population  of  males\\nincreases.  This  additional  mortality  depresses  the  overall  size  of\\nthe  tiger  population  not  only  by  removing  breeding  males  but  also\\nthrough  infanticide,  which  increases  with  greater  number  of  chal-\\nlenges.  Likewise,  as  the  population  of  breeding  females  increases,\\ndispersing  females  are  more  likely  to  die  from  starvation  as  they  are\\nunable  to  establish  a  resident  territory  large  enough  to  provide  suf-\\nﬁcient  food.  Further,  female  tigers  can  only  disperse  and  reside  in\\nareas  that  are  not  occupied  by  resident  females.  The  spatial  distri-\\nbution of  territories  thus  dictates  where  the  population  can  expand.\\nPrevious  ABMs  of  territorial  dynamics  typically  represent  terri-\\ntories  as  static  in  size  or  with  simple  shapes,  such  as  circles  (Ahearn\\net  al.,  2001;  Grimm  et  al.,  2003;  Kostova  et  al.,  2004;  Letcher  et  al.,\\n1998;  Wiegand  et  al.,  2004 ).  In  contrast,  territories  in  our  model  are\\nmore  ﬂexible  and  realistic,  and  they  constantly  optimize  size  and\\nshape  by  overlapping  highest  prey  resources  while  recognizing  the\\nboundaries  of  nearby  territories.  Furthermore,  our  model  improves\\non  previous  models  of  tiger  space  use  in  Chitwan  (Ahearn  et  al.,N.  Carter  et  al.  /  Ecological  Modelling  312  (2015)  347–362  361\\n2001;  Kenney  et  al.,  2014,  1995 ).  These  previous  models  did  not\\ninclude  dynamic  territories,  were  based  on  hypothetical  densities\\nof  prey,  and  simulated  movements  and  behaviors  for  which  empir-\\nical  data  are  scarce  and  difﬁcult  to  collect  throughout  most  of  the\\ntiger’s  geographic  range.  Our  model  utilized  empirically  derived\\nand  easily  replicable  estimates  of  prey  biomass  across  the  land-\\nscape  and  simulated  biologically  relevant  interactions  at  scales  that\\nare  relatively  easier  to  parameterize.  The  prey  resources  in  our\\nmodel  were  static  over  time,  however,  because  large-scale  seasonal\\nshifts  in  prey  biomass  do  not  appear  to  occur  in  Chitwan.  Fine-scale\\nprey  biomass  ﬂuctuations  due  to  predator  presence,  and  broader\\nchanges  in  prey  due  to  climate  change,  represent  important  future\\nresearch  activities.\\nOur  model  matched  closely  with  observed  patterns  of  the  real\\ntiger  population  in  Chitwan  National  Park.  Some  of  this  realism\\nwas  imposed  by  using  observed  litter  size,  and  age-speciﬁc  sur-\\nvival  rates,  or  by  calculating  prey  production  rates  from  observed\\nhome  range sizes. However,  it  should  be  noted  that  none  of  the\\nmodel  parameters  were  determined  by  ﬁtting  the  full  model  to\\ndata, i.e., by  calibration.  Most  of  the  parameters  used  in  the  model\\nwere  measured  directly  from  the  ﬁeld.  Several  parameters  were\\nbest-estimates derived from  the  literature  (e.g.,  the  area  a  breed-\\ning  female  can  potentially  add  to  her  territory  in  1  month).  These\\nparameters fortunately had  little  effect  on  model  outcomes  accord-\\ning  to  the  sensitivity  analysis.\\nIt  thus  seems  that  many  of  the  realistic  key  patterns  of  terri-\\ntory  dynamics  emerged  from  model  behaviors.  Spatial  structure\\nand  distribution  of  territories  related  to  the  spatial  distribution  of\\nprey  resources  and  presence  of  conspeciﬁcs.  For  example,  the  river-\\nine/grassland  areas  near  the  northern  edge  of  the  park  had  a  higher\\ntiger  density  and  smaller  territory  sizes  (Fig.  8),  indicating  higher\\npreference  for  those  areas  by  tigers  than  the  Churia  hills  where  prey\\nbiomass  is  lower.  Also,  dispersal  allows  for  the  tigers  in  the  model\\nto  avoid  conﬂict  with  each  other  and  take  advantage  of  as  much\\nof  the  Chitwan  landscape  as  possible.  Territory  dynamics  and  asso-\\nciated  mortality  processes  regulated  population  size  and  structure\\non  the  Chitwan  landscape.\\nDetailed  energy  considerations  regarding  the  ﬁtness  of  an  indi-\\nvidual  were  not  used  in  the  present  model.  For  example,  energy\\nintake by  females  could  be  used  to  determine  litter  size  and  sur-\\nvivorship.  The  probability  of  a  male  winning  a  challenge  could  be\\nrelated  to  how  much  recent  energy  he  consumed  from  prey.  Such\\nconsiderations  would  be  useful  in  exploring  subtle  issues  of  how\\ndifferences  in  competitive  ability  may  arise  through  genetic-based\\nor  chance  differences  in  the  foraging  histories  of  individuals,  or\\nwhat  determines  the  number  of  survivors  in  a  litter.  Also,  although\\nsome  aspects  of  learning  behavior  are  included  (memory  of  defeats\\nand  victories  in  challenges),  others,  such  as  a  tiger’s  gradual  learn-\\ning  about  the  environment,  were  not  considered  in  this  model.\\nField  data  to  parameterize  such  relationships  do  not  currently  exist.\\nInstead  we  used  rules  of  thumb  on  behavior  and  minimum  energy\\nrequirements  of  a  territory  for  survival  to  simplify  the  model  and\\nencourage  its  use  as  a  management  tool.\\nThe  close  correspondence  of  model  outputs  to  observed  pat-\\nterns  suggests  the  model  can  be  a  very  useful  tool  for  wildlife\\nresearchers  and  conservation  planners.  In  Chitwan,  for  example,\\nthe  current  model  can  serve  as  a  baseline  for  future  studies  aiming\\nto  evaluate  the  potential  effects  of  different  human  resource  use\\npatterns  (e.g.,  forest  degradation  and  fragmentation),  conservation\\npolicies  (e.g.,  forest  reforestation),  tiger  poaching  and  prey  hunting\\nrates,  and  various  land  uses  (e.g.,  roads)  on  the  tiger  population.\\nOur  model  builds  off  previous  ABMs  of  territorial  behaviors  and\\nincorporates  basic  principles  of  resource  requirements  and  con-\\nspeciﬁc  relationships.  When  adapted  somewhat  to  other  contexts,\\nthe model  can  test  different  anthropogenic  and  natural  impacts\\non  tiger  populations  elsewhere  across  their  range.  For  example,habitat-speciﬁc  data  on  prey  densities  and  empirical  estimates  of\\nterritory  sizes  would  theoretically  allow  application  of  the  model\\nto  other  sites,  such  as  those  in  India  and  Russia.  In  addition,  by\\nmaking  simple  adjustments  to  territory  behaviors  (e.g.,  allowing\\nfor  greater  overlap  or  less  site  ﬁdelity),  the  overall  model  structure\\nis  useful  and  easily  adaptable  for  understanding  population  and\\nterritory  dynamics  of  many  other  territorial  wildlife  species,  such\\nas  cougars  (Puma  concolor )  and  jaguars  (Panthera  onca ).\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work  beneﬁted  from  support  from  the  National  Socio-\\nEnvironmental  Synthesis  Center  (SESYNC)  –  NSF  award  DBI-\\n1052875.

About agents who make joint efforts for achievement of the\\ncommon long-term purpose, function in a dynamic environment at presence of\\x93noise\\x94 and counteraction on the part of the adversary it is accepted to talk, that theyform  the team of agents . Thus, the behavior of agents\\x92 team is something that greater,\\nthan simply coordinated set of individual actions of separate agents. It is accepted totalk, that agents \\x93 cooperate \\x94 in teamwork, i.e. they solve together some task or carry\\nout some activity for achievement of common goal. Therefore the main problem,\\nwhich is necessary to solve at organization of agents\\x92 teamwork , consists in how it ispossible to ensure the functioning of agents as the uniform team in a situation wheneach agent, generally speaking, realizes own intentions by individual actions executedin parallel or consistently with actions of other agents.\\n                                                          \\n* This research is being supported by grant 0 1-01-108 of Russian Foundation of Basic Re-\\nsearch and European Office of Aerospace R&D (Projects # 1994 P)Teamwork of Hackers-Agents      465\\nNow the research on teamwork is an area of steadfast attention in multi-agent sys-\\ntems [2, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc.]. This problem has many practically important and interest-\\ning applications. The paper considers an approach to teamwork of hackers-agents  for\\nmodeling and simulation the complex coordinated distributed attacks on computer\\nnetworks. This task is extremely actual today. In competition between security offi-\\ncers and means of computer network defense, on the one hand, and the hackers in-venting more complex exploits and smarter attacks, on the other hand, the significantadvantage is on the side of malefactors [5-7]. This advantage becomes even more es-sential in case when attack is coordinated and distributed in space and in time. Now itis not possible to detect such attacks fulfilled by professional hackers automatically. It\\nemphasizes a necessity of deeper studying an essence of modern attacks on computer\\nnetworks. Thus the goals and strategies of attacks, and also methods of its realizationshould be the objects of modeling and simulation. Such results could appear veryvaluable for construction of modern computer network defense systems.\\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2  outlines suggested common\\napproach for creation of hackers-agents teamwork. Section 3  describes the \\x93Computer\\nnetwork attacks\\x94 ontology used. Section 4  describes specifications of the agents\\x92 ac-\\ntions plans. Section 5  presents the Attack Simulator software prototype implemented\\nand its evaluation results.\\n2 Common Approach for Creation\\nof Hackers-Agents Teamwork\\nFor the organization of teamwork of hackers-agents realizing coordinated distributed\\nattacks, we have used the base ideas stated in the joint intention theory [2], the sharedplans theory [8] and the combined theories of agents\\x92 teamwork [9, 10, 11, etc.].\\nAs in the joint intention theory, the basic elements, allowing the agents\\x92 team to\\nfulfill a common task, are common (group) intentions, but its structuring is carried outin the same way as the plans are structured in the shared plans theory [ 10, 11]. The\\ncommon (group, individual) intention and commitment are associated with each node\\nof a general hierarchical plan. These intention and commitment manage execution ofa general plan, providing necessary flexibility. During functioning each agent shouldpossess the group beliefs concerning other team-mates. For achievement of the com-mon beliefs at formation and disbandment of the common intentions agents shouldcommunicate. All agents\\x92 communications are managed by means of common com-\\nmitments built in the common intentions. For this purpose it is supposed to use the\\nspecial mechanism for reasoning of agents on communications. Besides it is sup-posed, that agents communicate only when there can be an inconsistency of their ac-tions. This property is called \\x93selectivity of communications\\x94. It is important for re-action to unexpected changes of environment, maintenance of redistribution of rolesof the agents failed or unable to execute some part of a general plan, and also at oc-\\ncurrence new, earlier not planned actions [ 10, 11].\\nFor support of teamwork it is offered to use three groups of procedures  [10]: ( 1)\\nmaintenance of a coordination of actions; (2) monitoring and restoration of agents\\x92functionality; (3) maintenance of communication selectivity.466      Igor Kotenko\\nThe procedures of first class are intended for realization of coordinated initializa-\\ntion and termination of actions on some general plan. The coordinated initializationmeans, that all members of the team (group) begin execution of the same plan at thedefined time. It assumes an appointment for the fixed roles in concrete scenario of\\nconcrete agents, their notification about the appointed scenario and role, and also re-\\nception of confirmations on their readiness to play the defined role in the given sce-nario. The coordinated termination of a common action (refusal of the common inten-tion) demands also mutual informing of agents of the team (group) about this action atpresence of corresponding conditions. Such conditions can determined by achieve-ment of the common goal, finding-out by even one member of the team of unattain-\\nability of the goal or its prevarication (the goal has ceased to be actual). For example,\\nthe attack goal \\x93increase of authority up to a level of superuser\\x94 is achieved, if somehacker managed to penetrate into a target host and to increase the authority up to alevel of superuser. Also the purpose is unattainable, if one of obligatory actions onpenetration into a target host is not executed. And the purpose is irrelevant, if the tar-get host is switched off from the network.\\nProcedures of monitoring and restoration of the team (group)  functionality should\\nprovide supervision of some agents over others that it was possible to establish loss ofcapacity for work by the agent or a group of agents. It is directed on fast restoration offunctionality of the team at the expense of reassignment of the \"lost\" roles to thoseteam-mates which can perform corresponding additional job. For example, if one of\\nthe hackers-agents who are carrying out intention \\x93Identification of operating system\\nof a host\\x93 is blocked by firewall of a target network or other obstacle for realization ofthis intention takes place, this agent (or other hacker-agent who found out state ofnonoperability of \\x93colleague\\x94) should send this information to a \\x93leader\\x94 of the sce-nario. If there will be other agent, capable to solve the task this role should be as-signed to him. Check of rules and realization of reasoning results should entail corre-\\nsponding communications of agents by means of some communication protocol.\\nProcedures of maintenance of communication selectivity  order the communication\\nact when the probability and cost of agents\\x92 coordination loss is great enough. Theyare based on calculation of the message importance in view of the \\x93costs\\x94 and bene-fits of this message. It is necessary to guarantee that the benefit of the message ex-change for maintenance of agents\\x92 coordination surpasses a \\x93cost\\x94 of the communica-\\ntion act (for example, a network security system, having intercepted agents\\x92 mes-\\nsages, can detect and \\x93suppress\\x94 an attack). Therefore it is very important to choosethose communication acts which will bring the greatest benefit to the team.\\nThe suggested  technology for creation of the hackers-agents\\x92 team (that is fair for\\nother subject domains) consists in realization of the following chain of stages: ( 1)\\nformation of the subject domain ontology; (2) determination of the agents\\x92 team\\nstructure and mechanisms of their interaction and coordination (including roles and\\nscenarios of an agents\\x92 roles exchange); (3) specifications of the agents\\x92 actions plans(generation of attacks) as a hierarchy of attribute stochastic formal grammars; (4) as-signment of roles and allocation of plans between the agents; (5) state-machine basedinterpretation of the teamwork.\\nFormation of the subject domain ontology  is an initial stage of the agents\\x92 team\\ncreation. Modeling in any subject domain assumes development of its conceptualTeamwork of Hackers-Agents      467\\nmodel, i.e. set of basic concepts of a subject domain, relations between the concepts,\\nand also data and algorithms interpreting these concepts and relations.\\nThe agents\\x92 team structure  is described in terms of a hierarchy of group and indi-\\nvidual roles in the common scenario. Leaves of the hierarchy correspond to roles of\\nindividual agents, but intermediate nodes - to group roles.\\nThe plan hierarchy specification is carried out for each role. For group plans it is\\nnecessary to express joint activity obviously. The following elements are describedfor each plan: (a) entry conditions when the plan is offered for execution; (b) condi-tions at which the plan stops to be executed (the plan is executed, impracticable or ir-relevant on conditions); (c) actions which are carried out at a team level as a part of a\\ncommon plan. It is offered to carry out the plan hierarchy specification as a hierarchy\\nof attribute stochastic formal grammars, connected by substitution operation.\\nThe assignment of roles and allocation of plans between the agents  is carried out in\\ntwo stages: at first the plan is distributed in terms of roles, and then the agent is put incorrespondence to each role. One agent can execute a set of roles. Agents can ex-change roles in dynamics of the plan execution. Requirements to each role are for-\\nmulated as union of requirements to those parts of the plan which are put in corre-\\nspondence to the role. There are group and individual roles. Leaves correspond to in-dividual roles. Agents\\x92 functionalities are generated automatically according to theroles.\\nFor setting the agents\\x92 team operation in real-time a hierarchy of state machines  is\\nused. These state machines are built as a result of interpretation of a hierarchy of at-\\ntribute stochastic formal grammars which set the plan hierarchy specification.  The\\nstate machines realize a choice of the plan which will be executed and a fulfillment ofthe established sub-plans in a cycle \\x93agents\\x92 actions - responses of environment\\x94. Atjoint performance of the scenario agents\\x92 coordination is carried out by message ex-change. As the agents\\x92 team function in antagonistic environment agents can fail.\\nRestoration of lost functionalities is carried out by means of redistribution of roles of\\nthe failed agent between other agents and cloning of new agents.\\n3 \\x93Computer Network Attacks\\x94 Ontology\\nThe developed ontology comprises a hierarchy of notions specifying activities of team\\nof malefactors directed to implementation of attacks of various classes in different\\nlayers of detail. In this ontology, the hierarchy of nodes representing notions splits\\ninto two subsets according to the macro- and micro-layers of the  domain  specifica-\\ntions. All nodes of the ontology of attacks on the macro- and micro-levels of specifi-cation are divided into the intermediate (detailable) and terminal (non-detailable) [7].\\nThe notions of the ontology of an upper layer can be interconnected with the corre-\\nsponding notions of the lower layer through one of three kinds of relationships : (1)\\n\\x93Part of \\x94 that is decomposition relationship; (2) \\x93 Kind of \\x94 that is specialization rela-\\ntionship; and (3) \\x93 Seq of \\x93 that is relationship specifying sequence of operation.\\nHigh-layer notions corresponding to the intentions (see above) form the upper lay-\\ners of the ontology. They are interconnected by the \\x93 Part of \\x94 relationship. Attack ac-\\ntions realizing malefactor\\'s intentions (they presented at the lower layers as compared468      Igor Kotenko\\nwith the intentions) are interconnected with the intentions by \\x93 Kind of \\x94 or \\x93 Seq of \\x93\\nrelationship.\\nThe developed ontology includes the detailed description of the network attack\\ndomain in which the notions of the bottom layer (\\x93 terminals \\x94) can be specified in\\nterms of network packets, OS calls, and audit data.\\nLet us consider a high-layer fragment of the developed ontology.\\nFig. 1.  Macro-level fragment of the \" Network attack \" domain ontology\\nAt the upper-level of the macro-specification of attacks , the notion of \\x93Network\\nAttack\\x94 (designated by A) is in the \\x93 Part of \\x94 relationship to the \\x93Reconnaissance\\x94 ( R)\\nand \\x93Implantation and threat realization\\x94 ( I). In turn, the notion R is in the \\x93 Part of \\x94\\nrelationship to the notions IH, IS, IO, CI, RE, UE, and ABE. The notion I is in the\\n\\x93Part of \\x94 relationship to the notions GAR , EP, GAD , TR, CT, and CBD . In the next\\n(lower) level of the hierarchy of the problem domain ontology, for example, the no-\\ntion IH is in the \\x93 Kind of \\x94 relationship to the notions \\x93Network Ping Sweeps\\x94 ( DC)\\nand \\x93Port Scanning\\x94 ( SPIH ). At that, the notion \\x93Network Ping Sweeps\\x94 ( DC) is the\\nlowest (\\x93terminal\\x94) notion of the macro-level of attack specification, and the notion\\x93Port Scanning\\x94 ( SPIH ) is detailed through the use of the \\x93 Kind of \\x94 relationship by a\\nset of \\x93terminal\\x94 notions of the macro-level of attack specification.\\nThe \\x93terminal\\x94 notions of the macro-level are further elaborated on the micro-level\\nof attack specification , and on this level they belong to the set of top-level notions\\ndetailed through the use of the three relationships introduced above.\\nIn micro  specifications of the computer network attacks ontology, besides the three\\nrelations described (\\x93 Part of \\x94, \\x93Kind of \\x94, \\x93Seq of \\x94), the relationship \\x93 Example of \\x94 is\\nalso used. It serves to establish the \\x93type of object\\x96 specific sample of object\\x94 rela-tionship. For example, this type of relationship is used to establish the connectionTeamwork of Hackers-Agents      469\\nbetween the echo-request of the protocol ICMP (\\x93ICMP ECHO REQUEST\\x94) and its\\nspecific implementation specified, for example, as a message of the program\\ntcpdump : <time> <src_addr> > <dest_addr>: icmp: echo request,\\nwhere <time> \\x96 a time stamp, <src_addr>  \\x96 source IP address, <src_port>  \\x96\\nsource port, <dest_addr>  \\x96 destination IP address.\\n4 Specification of Hackers-Agents\\x92 Plans\\nCommon formal plan of distributed attacks  implemented by team of hacker-agents\\nhas three-level structure: ( 1) Upper level  is a level of intention-based scenarios of\\nmalefactors\\x92 team specified in terms of time-ordered sequences of intentions and ne-gotiation acts; (2) Middle level  is a level of intention-based scenarios of each male-\\nfactor specified in terms of an ordered sequences of sub-goals; (3) Lower level  is a\\nlevel of malefactor\\x92s intention realization specified in terms of low-level actions.\\nMathematical model of attacks is specified in terms of a set of formal grammars\\ninterconnected through \\x93 substitution \\x94 operations [ 1, 3, 4]: M\\nA=<{Gi}, {Su}> , where\\n{Gi} \\x96 the formal grammars, {Su} \\x96 the \\x93substitution\\x94 operations. The sequences of\\nsymbols (\\x93strings\\x94, \\x93words\\x94 \\x96 in formal grammar terminology) generated by each  of\\nsuch grammars correspond to the sequences of time ordered malefactor\\'s intentions or\\nactions. It is assumed that every sequence of a malefactor\\'s actions viewed as a\\x93word\\x94 in a formal language is specified through a family of enclosed context-freegrammars recognizable by a corresponding family of state machines. At the scenariospecification layer (it was earlier called macro-layer ) such sequences correspond to\\nthe specification of scenarios in terms of the malefactor\\'s  intentions and actions.\\nThe formal model of attack scenarios in terms of formal grammars are based on the\\nattacks ontology described above. It is noteworthy to notice that each node of the on-tology that is not \\x93terminal\\x94 one is mapped to particular grammar, which is capable togenerate only admissible sequences realizing this intention in terms of symbols, cor-responding to the ontology nodes of the immediately lower layer. Depending on the\\nrequired level of detail, these nodes may be represented by the terminal nodes of the\\nmacro or micro-level. In the former case, the grammar may be used to visualize themalefactor\\'s actions, and in the latter case \\x96 for attack simulation in the lowest layerterms (if the \\x93terminal\\x94 nodes of the micro-level are represented by network packets,OS commands and/or calling applications with specified parameters).\\nEvery formal grammar is specified by quintuple [ 1, 3, 4]: G=<V\\nN,VT,S,P,A> ,\\nwhere G is the grammar identifier (name), VN  is the set of non-terminal symbols (that\\nare associated with the upper and the intermediate levels of representation of the stepsof an attack scenario),  V\\nT  is the set of its terminal symbols (that designate the steps of\\na lower-level attack scenario), S∈ VN  is the grammar axiom (an initial symbol of an\\nattack scenario), P is the set of productions (production rules) that specify the refine-\\nment operations for the attack scenario through the substitution of the symbols of anupper-level node by the symbols of the lower-level nodes, and A  is the set of attrib-\\nutes and algorithms of their computation.\\nAttribute component  of each grammar serves for several purposes. The first of\\nthem is to specify randomized choice of a production  at the current inference step if470      Igor Kotenko\\nseveral productions have the equal left part non-terminals coinciding with the active\\nnon-terminal in the current sequence under inference. These probabilities could berecalculated on-line subject to the pre-history of attack development and previous re-sults of attack. So, in order to specify a stochastic grammar, each production is sup-\\nplemented with a specification of the probability of the rule being chosen in case of an\\nattack implementation. The length of the string of actions (intentions) that disclose theupper-level action (intention) depends primarily on the attack goal that has been setand on the degree of the target protection. The length of the string is determined bythe specified probabilities of the selected productions. For the productions with thesame left parts the sum of probabilities of choice is 1. The probability of a certain type\\nattack is determined by the multiplication of probabilities of productions used.\\nAlso the attribute component is used to check conditions determining the admissi-\\nbility of using a production at the current step of inference. These conditions depend\\non task specification (general attack goal), configuration of computer network (host)and its resources and results of the malefactor\\x92s previous actions.\\nAlgorithmic interpretation of the attack generation specified as a family of formal\\ngeneralized grammars is implemented by a family of state machines. The basic ele-\\nments of each state machine are states, transition arcs, and explanatory texts for eachtransition. States of each state machine are divided into three types: first (initial), in-termediate, and final (marker of this state is End). The initial and intermediate states\\nare as follows: non-terminal, those that initiate the work of the corresponding nested\\nstate machines; terminal, those that interact with the host model; abstract (auxiliary)\\nstates. Transition arcs are identified with the productions of grammars, and can becarried out only under certain conditions. Within the state, besides the transitionchoice depending on the intention and the current transition probability, the followingtypes of action can be performed: Entry action  (an action performed on entering the\\nstate); Do action  (a set of basic actions, including actions of transition to the nested\\nstate machine or realizing the host response model); Exit action  (an action performed\\non exiting). For the fragment of the attack domain elaborated, the family of finite statemachines includes 50 state machines.\\n5 Attack Simulator Prototype and Its Evaluation Results\\nThe software prototype for computer network attack simulation is built as a multi-\\nagent system that uses two classes of agents: ( 1) Network Agent and (2) Hacker\\nAgent. The Network Agent  simulates the attacked computer network and its defensive\\nsystem. The Hacker Agent  simulates a malefactor performing attack against computer\\nnetwork. The developed technology makes it possible to model and simulate a teamof hackers and a team of agents responsible for computer network security.\\nThe aforementioned agents are implemented on the basis of the technology sup-\\nported by Multi-Agent System Development Kit (MASDK) [5] that is a software tool\\naiming at support of the design and implementation of multi-agent systems of a broadrange. The Attack Simulator comprises the multitude of reusable components gener-ated by use of the MASDK standard functionalities and application-oriented softwarecomponents developed in terms of programming language MS Visual C++ 6.0 SP 5.Teamwork of Hackers-Agents      47 1\\nFig. 2. Visualization of attack development\\nEach agent operates using the respective fragment of the application ontology that\\nis designed by use of an editor of MASDK facilities. The interaction between agents\\nin the process of attack simulation is supported by the communication environment,which design and implementation is also supported by MASDK. While simulating anattack in order either to obtain response providing it with the needed information from\\nthe Network Agent (on the reconnaissance stage) or to perform an attack action (on\\nthe threat realization stage) Hacker Agent sends a certain message to the NetworkAgent. The Network Agent, like this takes place in real-life interactions, analyzes thereceived message and forms a responsive message. This message is formed based onthe Network Agent\\'s knowledge base that models the network configuration and all itsattributes needed to simulate the real-life response. This knowledge base also uses in-\\nformation about possible existing attacks and reaction of the network on them.\\nThe key components of both agents correspond to so-called kernels that are the\\nmodules written in C++ and compiled into a dll. These components provide interface\\nbetween the part of the software written in C++ and the components implementedthrough use of MASDK. The kernels provide interfaces to the respective fragments ofthe application ontology, and initialize the state machines executing scripts.\\nThe Hacker Agent comprises the following main components: Kernel; fragment of\\nthe application domain ontology; state machines model; scripts; attack task specifica-472      Igor Kotenko\\ntion component; probabilistic (stochastic) decision making model with regard to the\\nfurther actions; network traffic generator; visualization component of the attack sce-nario development. The main components of the Network Agent are as follows: Ker-nel; fragment of the application domain ontology; state machines model component;\\nscripts component; network configuration specification component; firewall model\\n(implementation) component; generator of the network\\x92s response to attack action.\\nThe main objective of the experiments with the Attack Simulator prototype has\\nconsisted in demonstration of its efficiency for various specifications of attacks andan attacked network configuration. The authors had the purpose to investigate the At-tack Simulator prototype possibilities for realization of the following tasks: ( 1)\\nChecking a computer network security policy at stages of conceptual and logic designof network security system . This task can be solved by simulation of attacks at a\\nmacro-level and researches of responding a being designed (analyzed) networkmodel; (2) Checking security policy (including vulnerabilities recognition) of a real-\\nlife computer network . This task can be solved by means of simulation of attacks at a\\nmicro-level, i.e. by generating a network traffic corresponding to real activity of male-\\nfactors on realization of various security threats. The simulation-based exploration\\nhas demonstrated the Attack Simulator efficacy for accomplishing various attack sce-\\nnarios against networks with different structures and security policies implemented.\\nIn the experiments with simulation of attacks on macro-level, explorations of at-\\ntacks for all malefactor\\'s intentions implemented have been accomplished. These ex-\\nperiments were carried out for various parameters of the attack task specification and\\nan attacked computer network configuration. Besides malefactor\\x92s intention, it wasinvestigated the influence on attacks efficacy of the following input parameters : pro-\\ntection degree of network and personal firewall, protection degree of attacked host(for example, how strong is the password, does the host has sharing files, printers andother resources, does the host use trusted hosts, etc.), and degree of hacker\\x92s knowl-\\nedge about a network. To investigate the Attack Simulator capabilities, the following\\nparameters of attack realization outcome  have been selected: number of terminal\\nlevel attack actions (NS), percentage of the hacker\\x92s intentions realized successfully(PIR), percentage of \\x93effective\\x94 network responses on attack actions (PAR), percent-age of attack actions blockage by firewall (PFB), percentage of \\x93ineffective\\x94 resultsof attack actions (when attack is not successful) (PRA). In all experiments the Attack\\nSimulator allows to generate the clearly interpretable results.\\nFig. 3.  Diagram  of attack outcome parameters for intention  ISTeamwork of Hackers-Agents      473\\nAs an example of scenario, fulfilled by Attack Simulator, let us consider screen in-\\ndicating generation of the attack CVR (\\x93Confidentiality Violation Realization\\x94)(Fig.2). In the figure the information is divided on four groups: ( 1) the attack task\\nspecification units are mapped in the left top of the screen; (2) to the right of them the\\nattack generation tree is visualized; (3) the strings of the malefactor\\x92 s actions are\\nplaced in the left part of the screen below the attack task specification; (4) on the rightof each malefactor\\x92s action a tag of success (failure) as green (black or red) quadrateand data obtained from an attacked host (a host response) are depicted.\\nGraphical representation of attack realization outcome parameters values at reali-\\nzation of intention IS (Identification of the host Services ) depending on values of pro-\\ntection degree of network firewall ( 1 - \"Strong\"; 2 - \"Medium\"; 3 - \"None\") is dis-\\nplayed in Fig.3.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn the paper we described basic ideas of the modeling and simulation of coordinated\\ndistributed attacks by teamwork approach . Mathematical methods and techniques re-\\nalizing attack agent-based modeling and simulation were developed.\\nSoftware prototype of Attack Simulator is presented. The attack simulator allows\\nsimulating a wide spectrum of real life attacks. Its software code is written in terms ofVisual C++ 6.0, Java 2 version 1.3.1, KQML and XML languages. The developed\\ntechnology makes it possible to simulate adversary interactions  of a team of hackers\\nand a team of network defense agents.\\nTwo types of experiments  have been fulfilled: ( 1) simulation of attacks on macro-\\nlevel (generation and investigation of malicious actions against computer networkmodel have been carried out); (2) simulation of attacks on micro-level (generationmalicious network traffic against a real computer network has been fulfilled). Thesimulation-based exploration of the Attack Simulator prototype  has demonstrated its\\nefficacy for accomplishing various attack scenarios against networks with different\\nstructures and security policies implemented.\\nThe further research  can consist of more detailed developing teamwork support\\nprocedures, extending attack classes, supporting more complicated structures of theattacked networks, implementing more sophisticated attack scenarios using differentattack objects and exploits, etc.\\nReferences\\n[1] Aho, A.V., Ullman, J.D.: The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling,\\nVol. 1, 2, Prentice-Hall, Inc.

variability of \\nsolar and demand is introduced.', 'A novel set of constraints which enforce \\nthe microgrid power balance on the worst-case conditions of intra-hour \\nvariability are introduced.', 'PB is a staged model.', 'First, an hourly opti-\\nmization using a representative set of days sets the lower bound on in-\\nvestment decisions.', 'Second, the power balance constraints are included \\nto consider intra-hour variability.', 'The optimization is extended to all \\ndays at hourly resolution.', 'In the final stage, DER capacities are fixed and \\ndispatch decisions are optimized at the timescale of interest.', 'Impor -\\ntantly, intra-hour variability is included without increasing the time- \\ndimension of the techno-economic investment problem.', 'Thus, run-\\ntimes are exceptionally faster than full-scale-optimizations of compa -\\nrable resolutions without a significant loss in optimality.', 'PB is validated using a sample residential microgrid case study at \\ntimescales of 5-min, 15-min, 30-min, and 60-min.', 'As timescale de-\\ncreases, ESS inverter investments increase to provide the balancing \\npower required to meet intermittent demand spikes.', 'PB results are \\ncompared to the minimum investment optimization and a full-scale- \\noptimization.', 'For all scales, optimality is within 5% of the full-scale- \\noptimization.', 'For 5-min and 15-min scales, optimality improves to \\nwithin 2%.', 'Runtime improvement is also demonstrated.', 'At 5-min reso-\\nlution, PB runtime is only 1.8% of the full-scale-optimization and im-\\nproves on the minimum investment optimization by 4.1 min.', 'Notably, \\nthe choice of representative daytype in the initial stage will have a \\nsignificant impact on the final PB investment decision.', 'For the presented \\ncase, the representative peak daytype may be overly conservative, \\nresulting in DER investment decisions that favor generator investment \\nover ESS investment.', 'Though unfulfilled energy was not observed for the presented case, \\nPB cannot generally guarantee a robust solution for the high-resolution \\ndispatch stage.', 'The investment sizing stage of PB only considers vari-\\nability magnitude and not intra-hour timing.', 'Therefore, in the high- \\nresolution dispatch stage, the potential exists for energy shortfalls in \\nhours in which timing is important.', 'This is evident when PV curtailment \\nis considered.', 'Consider an hourly energy balance in which PV meets \\ndemand and the ESS state of charge is at capacity.', 'In the high-resolution \\noptimization, a positive solar spike exists in the first intra-hour timestep.', 'In this scenario, PV production exceeds demand and the ESS cannot \\naccept energy.', 'Therefore, PV production must be curtailed.', 'This \\nremoves energy from the system that exists in the hourly optimization.', 'Later within the same hour, PV production is lower than the hourly \\naverage and insufficient to meet demand.', 'Therefore, ESS must be dis-\\npatched to meet demand and offsetting the energy removed via PV \\ncurtailment.', 'At the end of the hour, ESS state-of-charge is depleted \\nwhich may lead to energy shortfalls later.', 'Conversely, when a large solar \\ndeficit is observed in the first intra-hour timestep, ESS is also deployed to \\nmeet demand.', 'However, the ESS can recharge via the positive solar spike \\nobserved later in the hour, preserving the initial hourly energy balance.', 'Although robustness cannot be guaranteed, annual unfulfilled energy \\nwill be small for most practical cases.', 'As is standard in Microgrid and DER planning algorithms, this \\nmethod assumes that input time-series profiles are known a priori \\n(typically derived from historic data).', 'As such, technology investments \\nand dispatch decisions are optimized without considering uncertainty in \\nthe input data.', 'Thus, optimized sizing may not produce the projected \\nresults when deployed in the field, especially when paired with inac-\\ncurate operational forecasting.', 'Importantly, however, this method mit-\\nigates the risks of misaligned input data or intra-hour forecasting error.', 'Since the algorithm only considers the worst cast spike of intra-hour \\nvariability, so long as the magnitude of intra-hour spikes are predicted \\nwith accuracy, uncertainty in the timing of such events will not impact \\nthe optimal dispatch decisions.', 'For that reason, the authors believe this \\nmethod faces the same challenges as other hourly resolution planning \\nalgorithms, but potentially improves over explicit intra-hour resolution \\ntechniques which plan around each distinct time-step.', 'Note, specific \\nresults exploring the impact of uncertainty are not tested in this paper.', 'Finally, similar intra-hour PB constraints are easily extended to wind \\nproduction, solar thermal energy capture, or heat producing \\nFig.',

relationshipthat the multilayer perceptron is attempting to ap-proximate.', 'In particular, this function must besmooth, by which a small change in an input onlyresults in a small change in the

forextrapolation.', 'The training data must fully representall cases about which the multilayer perceptron willbe required to generalise from.', 'If both these condi-\\ntions are satisÞed, and the multilayer perceptron is\\ntrained with a suitable training algorithm, then theperformance of the network will be good.', 'Some fur-ther issues relating to the selection of training datacan be found in Lawrence (1991).', 'Given a set of data, the question arises of how best\\nto divide the data into training, validation and test\\nsets, such that the conclusions drawn from the multi-layer perceptron are valid and performance isrepresentative.', 'If, for example, the data are dividedrandomly there is a chance that the data in one of thesets may be biased towards extreme or uncommon\\nevents.', 'This will cause problems when assessing the\\nperformance of the network.', 'A network can onlygeneralise on the range of data inputs for which it wastrained.', 'This is a particular problem when workingwith small data sets, when good or bad performancecould be related to the selection of the various data\\nsubsets.', 'One way around this problem is known as\\nV-fold cross-validation, and involves randomly divid-ing the data into ÔÔVÕÕ independent subsets (Stone,1974).', 'The multilayer perceptron is then trained oneach subset and its performance on the remain-ing data is recorded.', 'The stability of the training can\\nthen be used to gauge the conÞdence that can be\\nplaced on the network performance when trained withall the data.', 'An excellent overview of the problemsassociated with data modelling, and determiningmeasures of performance, can be found in Breimanet al.', '(1984).', 'Often, especially in the atmospheric sciences, suc-\\ncessfully modelling the average behaviour of a systemis not the desired goal.', 'It is important that the modelcan resolve infrequent, extreme events which are oftenof great importance.', 'Several approaches to overcomethis problem have been suggested, including data\\npre-processing, and by making adjustments to the\\ntraining algorithm so that well learnt patterns aretemporarily ignored from the training process (Listeret al., 1993).', 'Decisions need to be made in choosing suitable\\nvalues for the learning rate and momentum para-\\nmeters required by the backpropagation training al-\\ngorithm.', 'The best values to use are problem-speciÞc.Le Cun et al.', '(1993) describe a process which candetermine the maximum possible value of the learning\\nrate.', 'If a network fails to converge an increase inmomentum and a decrease in the learning rate may\\nhelp.', 'If the network oscillates around a solution or\\nbecomes unstable then decreasing the learning ratemay result in convergence.', 'The selection of suitablelearning parameters requires a degree of judgementand is perhaps the most unattractive aspect of thebackpropagation algorithm.', 'More sophisticated algo-\\nrithms avoid the need to specify such sensitive train-\\ning parameters.', 'There are many activation functions which can be\\nused in place of the logistic function.', 'Virtually, allnon-linear functions could be used, however for thebackpropagation algorithm the function must be dif-\\nferentiable.', 'Bounded functions are preferred, since\\nthese will prevent weights from taking very largevalues, slowing convergence during training.', 'One al-ternative to the logistic function is the hyperbolictangent (tanh) function.', 'Di¤erent layers in the net-work can have di¤erent activation functions.', 'It is\\noften useful, for example, to have an unbounded func-\\ntion (usually the identity function y\"x) at the output\\nlayer.', 'This enables the outputs to take a range ofvalues without being bounded to the limits of thefunction, for example between 0 and 1 for the logisticfunction.', 'Rescaling input data between 0 and 1 is often re-\\nported in papers describing applications of the multi-layer perceptron.', 'In theory this is unnecessary sinceany rescaling can be compensated for within the net-work by adjusting the input to hidden layer weights.In practice, initial network weights are chosen ran-\\ndomly.', 'Therefore, if one input has a large range and\\nanother has a small range, but both exhibit a similaramount of variance, then the network may ignorethe small input due to the large contribution from theother input.', 'It is therefore advisable to standardisethe inputs to the multilayer perceptron, by dividing\\nthe input by the standard deviation of all values in the\\ntraining data.', 'This may also assist with the interpreta-tion of network weights.', 'Backpropagation is slow and is particularly a¤ec-\\nted by the ÔÔcurse of dimensionalityÕÕ (after Bellman,1961).', 'As the dimensionality of the data increases, the\\namount of training data required by the multilayer\\nperceptron rapidly increases.', 'Similarly, as the databecome more complex the number of weights, andhence the size of the network, rapidly increases.', 'Boththese problems serve to slow the speed at which thebackpropagation algorithm will converge.', 'One solu-\\ntion to this problem is to reduce the dimensionality of\\nthe input data, which can be achieved through the useof principal components, or by removing redundantvariables from the input data.', 'This process is knownas feature selection (Setiono and Liu, 1996).', 'An alter-native solution is to use a di¤erent algorithm.', 'The\\nnumber of algorithms that exist, and all their deriva-\\ntives, make it very

is accepted totalk, that agents \\x93 cooperate \\x94 in teamwork, i.e.', 'they solve together some task or carry\\nout some activity for achievement of common goal.', 'Therefore the main problem,\\nwhich is necessary to solve at organization of agents\\x92 teamwork , consists in how it ispossible to ensure the functioning of agents as the uniform team in a situation wheneach agent, generally speaking, realizes own intentions by individual actions executedin parallel or consistently with actions of other agents.', '* This research is being supported by grant 0 1-01-108 of Russian

for\\nmodeling and simulation the complex coordinated distributed attacks on computer\\nnetworks.', 'This task is extremely actual today.', 'In competition between security offi-\\ncers and means of computer network defense, on the one hand, and the hackers in-venting more complex exploits and smarter attacks, on the other hand, the significantadvantage is on the side of malefactors [5-7].', 'This advantage becomes even more es-sential in case when attack is coordinated and distributed in space and in time.', 'Now itis not possible to detect such attacks fulfilled by professional hackers automatically.', 'It\\nemphasizes a necessity of deeper studying an essence of modern attacks on computer\\nnetworks.', 'Thus the goals and strategies of attacks, and also methods of its realizationshould be the objects of modeling and simulation.', 'Such results could appear veryvaluable for construction of modern computer network defense systems.', 'The rest of the paper is

'Section 4  describes specifications of the agents\\x92 ac-\\ntions plans.', 'Section 5  presents the Attack Simulator software prototype implemented\\nand its evaluation results.', '2 Common Approach for Creation\\nof Hackers-Agents Teamwork\\nFor the organization of teamwork of hackers-agents realizing coordinated distributed\\nattacks, we have used the base ideas stated in the joint intention theory [2], the sharedplans theory [8] and the combined theories of agents\\x92 teamwork [9, 10, 11, etc.].', 'As in the joint intention theory, the basic elements, allowing the agents\\x92 team to\\nfulfill a common task, are common (group) intentions, but its structuring is carried outin the same way as the plans are structured in the shared plans theory [ 10, 11].', 'The\\ncommon (group, individual) intention and commitment are associated with each node\\nof a general hierarchical plan.', 'These intention and commitment manage execution ofa general plan, providing necessary flexibility.', 'During functioning each agent shouldpossess the group beliefs concerning other team-mates.', 'For achievement of the com-mon beliefs at formation and disbandment of the common intentions agents shouldcommunicate.', 'All agents\\x92 communications are managed by means of common com-\\nmitments built in the common intentions.', 'For this purpose it is supposed to use the\\nspecial mechanism for reasoning of agents on communications.', 'Besides it is sup-posed, that agents communicate only when there can be an inconsistency of their ac-tions.', 'This property is called \\x93selectivity of communications\\x94.', 'It is important for re-action to unexpected changes of environment, maintenance of redistribution of rolesof the agents failed or unable to execute some part of a general plan, and also at oc-\\ncurrence new, earlier not planned actions [ 10, 11].', 'For support of teamwork it is offered to use three groups of procedures  [10]: ( 1)\\nmaintenance of a coordination of actions; (2) monitoring and restoration of agents\\x92functionality; (3) maintenance of communication selectivity.466      Igor Kotenko\\nThe procedures of first class are intended for realization of coordinated initializa-\\ntion and termination of actions on some general plan.', 'The coordinated initializationmeans, that all members of the team (group) begin execution of the same plan at thedefined time.', 'It assumes an appointment for the fixed roles in concrete scenario of\\nconcrete agents, their notification about the appointed scenario and role, and also re-\\nception of confirmations on their readiness to play the defined role in the given sce-nario.', 'The coordinated termination of a common action (refusal of the common inten-tion) demands also mutual informing of agents of the team (group) about this action atpresence of corresponding conditions.', 'Such conditions can determined by achieve-ment of the common goal, finding-out by even one member of the team of unattain-\\nability of the goal or its prevarication (the goal has ceased to be actual).', 'For example,\\nthe attack goal \\x93increase of authority up to a level of superuser\\x94 is achieved, if somehacker managed to penetrate into a target host and to increase the authority up to alevel of superuser.', 'Also the purpose is unattainable, if one of obligatory actions onpenetration into a target host is not executed.', 'And the purpose is irrelevant, if the tar-get host is switched off from the network.', 'Procedures of monitoring and restoration of the team (group)  functionality should\\nprovide supervision of some agents over others that it was possible to establish loss ofcapacity for work by the agent or a group of agents.', 'It is directed on fast restoration offunctionality of the team at the expense of reassignment of the \"lost\" roles to thoseteam-mates which can perform corresponding additional job.', 'For example, if one of\\nthe hackers-agents who are carrying out intention \\x93Identification of operating system\\nof a host\\x93 is blocked by firewall of a target network or other obstacle for realization ofthis intention takes place, this agent (or other hacker-agent who found out state ofnonoperability of \\x93colleague\\x94) should send this information to a \\x93leader\\x94 of the sce-nario.', 'If there will be other agent, capable to solve the task this role should be as-signed to him.', 'Check of rules and realization of reasoning results should entail corre-\\nsponding communications of agents by means of some communication protocol.', 'Procedures of maintenance of communication selectivity  order the communication\\nact when the probability and cost of agents\\x92 coordination loss is great enough.', 'Theyare based on calculation of the message importance in view of the \\x93costs\\x94 and bene-fits of this message.', 'It is necessary to guarantee that the benefit of the message ex-change for maintenance of agents\\x92 coordination surpasses a \\x93cost\\x94 of the communica-\\ntion act (for example, a network security system, having intercepted agents\\x92 mes-\\nsages, can detect and \\x93suppress\\x94 an attack).', 'Therefore it is very important to choosethose communication acts which will bring the greatest benefit to the team.', 'The suggested  technology for creation of the hackers-agents\\x92 team (that is fair for\\nother subject domains) consists in realization of the following chain of stages: ( 1)\\nformation of the subject domain ontology; (2) determination of the agents\\x92 team\\nstructure and mechanisms of their interaction and coordination (including roles and\\nscenarios of an agents\\x92 roles exchange); (3) specifications of the agents\\x92 actions plans(generation of attacks) as a hierarchy of attribute stochastic formal grammars; (4) as-signment of roles and allocation of plans between the agents; (5) state-machine basedinterpretation of the teamwork.', 'Formation of the subject domain ontology  is an initial stage of the agents\\x92 team\\ncreation.', 'Modeling in any subject domain assumes development of its conceptualTeamwork of Hackers-Agents      467\\nmodel, i.e.', 'set of basic concepts of a subject domain, relations between the concepts,\\nand also data and algorithms interpreting these concepts and relations.', 'The agents\\x92 team structure  is described in terms of a hierarchy of group and indi-\\nvidual roles in the common scenario.', 'Leaves of the hierarchy correspond to roles of\\nindividual agents, but intermediate nodes - to group roles.', 'The plan hierarchy specification is carried out for each role.', 'For group plans it is\\nnecessary to express joint activity obviously.', 'The following elements are describedfor each plan: (a) entry conditions when the plan is offered for execution; (b) condi-tions at which the plan stops to be executed (the plan is executed, impracticable or ir-relevant on conditions); (c) actions which are carried out at a team level as a part of a\\ncommon plan.', 'It is offered to carry out the plan hierarchy specification as a hierarchy\\nof attribute stochastic formal grammars, connected by substitution operation.', 'The assignment of roles and allocation of plans between the agents  is carried out in\\ntwo stages: at first the plan is distributed in terms of roles, and then the agent is put incorrespondence to each role.', 'One agent can execute a set of roles.', 'Agents can ex-change roles in dynamics of the plan execution.', 'Requirements to each role are for-\\nmulated as union of requirements to those parts of the plan which are put in corre-\\nspondence to the role.', 'There are group and individual roles.', 'Leaves correspond to in-dividual roles.', 'Agents\\x92 functionalities are generated automatically according to theroles.', 'For setting the agents\\x92 team operation in real-time a hierarchy of state machines  is\\nused.', 'These state machines are built as a result of interpretation of a hierarchy of at-\\ntribute stochastic formal grammars which set the plan hierarchy specification.', 'The\\nstate machines realize a choice of the plan which will be executed and a fulfillment ofthe established sub-plans in a cycle \\x93agents\\x92 actions - responses of environment\\x94.', 'Atjoint performance of the scenario agents\\x92 coordination is carried out by message ex-change.', 'As the agents\\x92 team function in antagonistic environment agents can fail.', 'Restoration of lost functionalities is carried out by means of redistribution of roles of\\nthe failed agent between other agents and cloning of new agents.', '3 \\x93Computer Network Attacks\\x94 Ontology\\nThe developed ontology comprises a hierarchy of notions specifying activities of team\\nof malefactors directed to implementation of attacks of various classes in different\\nlayers of detail.', 'In this ontology, the
